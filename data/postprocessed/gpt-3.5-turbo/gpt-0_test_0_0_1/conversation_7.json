You asked if the number was smaller than 700, to which I answered yes.\n3. You requested the original number and transformation, which I provided along with the resulting hash.\n4. You asked if the result of the transformation matched the original hash, to which I answered yes.\n\nAfter reviewing all the questions, I can confirm that all questions were answered correctly."
