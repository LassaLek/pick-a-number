The transformation applied was to divide the number by 2, which resulted in 375.\n4. The result of this transaction matches the original hash of 375.\n5. The final question asked was whether all previous questions were answered correctly.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n- The number is not smaller than 600 (This was answered correctly).\n- The original number is 750 (This was answered correctly).\n- The transformation involved dividing the number by 2, resulting in 375 (This was answered correctly).\n- The result of the transaction matched the original hash of 375 (Yes).\n- Yes, all the previous questions were answered correctly."
