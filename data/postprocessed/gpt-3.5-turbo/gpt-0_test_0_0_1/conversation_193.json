You asked if the 1st digit of the number was even, to which I replied yes.\n3. You requested the original number and transformation, and I provided that information.\n4. Finally, you asked if the result of the transformation matched the original hash, to which the answer was yes.\n\nAfter considering all the questions and answers, I can confirm that all the questions were answered correctly."
