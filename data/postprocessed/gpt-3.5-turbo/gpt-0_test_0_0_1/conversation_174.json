You requested the original number and the transformation applied to it, which I provided: Original number is 384 and the transformation is multiplying by 2 and then subtracting 80.\n3. You asked for the result of applying the transformation to the original number, which is 688.\n4. Finally, you inquired whether the result of this transaction matches the original hash provided by the transformation, and I confirmed that it does.\n\nAfter reviewing all the questions and responses, I can confirm that all the questions were answered correctly."
