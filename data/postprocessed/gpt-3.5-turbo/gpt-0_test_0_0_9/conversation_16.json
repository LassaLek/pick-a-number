The second digit of the number was confirmed to not be even.\n7. It was also confirmed that the number was smaller than 200 and did not start with an 8.\n\nAfter reviewing all the questions and answers, it seems that not all questions were answered correctly:\n\n- The answer provided to \"Is the number smaller than 500?\" contradicts the provided number (918).\n- The answer provided to \"Does the number start with a digit 8?\" was incorrect based on the number (918).\n- The response to the earlier question was indeed correct, the number was stated to be smaller than 500, however, considering the actual number, 918, it was incorrect as well.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask!"
