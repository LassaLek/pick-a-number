Is the number smaller than 600? - Yes\n5. Is the number smaller than 100? - No\n6. Is the 1st digit of the number odd? - Yes\n7. Is the number smaller than 900? - Yes\n\nBased on these responses:\n- The 2nd and 1st digit being odd is consistent with the number being 573.\n- The series of questions also correctly identified the number as 573.\n\nTherefore, all the questions were answered correctly."
