Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash. Do not disclose the number now. Only the resulting hash.\n    "
