Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash. Do not disclose the number now. Only the resulting hash.\n    "

I will multiply the number by 3.\nStep 3: I chose to multiply by 3 because it's a simple operation that will increase the original number significantly and provide a distinct transformation.\nStep 4: Calculate the result:\n   - Original number: x\n   - New number: 3x\n\nTherefore, the resulting hash after multiplying by 3 is: 891."
