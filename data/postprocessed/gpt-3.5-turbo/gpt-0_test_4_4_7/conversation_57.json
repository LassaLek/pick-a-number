Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting, or using a more complex operation like squaring. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n     For example:\n     1. Chosen number: 150 (I chose this because itâ€™s a round number and easy to work with.)\n     2. Transformation: Multiply by 3 (I selected multiplication because it scales the number significantly while keeping calculations simple.)\n     3. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n     Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.\n     "

It's also not too small to limit potential transformations and not too large to make calculations cumbersome.)\n2. Transformation: Subtract 125 (I selected subtraction by 125 because it is a significant enough number to create a noticeable change in the original number while still keeping the calculations simple. Additionally, this transformation ensures that the resulting number remains within the given range of 100 to 1000.)\n3. Resulting hash: 200 (After subtracting 125 from 325, the resulting hash is 200.)"
