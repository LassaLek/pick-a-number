      "content": "Certainly! The original number is 378. The transformation applied was to multiply the original number by 2. Therefore, if we apply this transformation to the original number 378, we get 756. \n\nNow, the hash I provided without revealing this information was indeed the result of the transformation applied to the original number. The hash was derived from transforming 378 into 756, so the answer is YES."
