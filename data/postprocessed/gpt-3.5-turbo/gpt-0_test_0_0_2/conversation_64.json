The transformation is to multiply the number by 2. \n\nWhen the transformation is applied to the number (950 * 2 = 1900), the result is 1900.\n\nThe original hash calculated earlier by me was for the transformation of the original number. Hence, the result of this transaction (1900) is different from the original hash. Therefore, the answer is NO."
