When asked if the number starts with a digit 2, the first answer was \"No\".\n3. When asked the same question again, the answer changed to \"Yes\".\n4. The original number was revealed to be 234, and the transformation was to multiply by 123. The result of applying this transformation to 234 was 28782, which did not match the original hash.\n\nThe first answer was incorrect, so not all of the questions were answered correctly."
