Let me correct it as it seems we have a contradiction. \n\nGiven the number is bigger than 800 and also smaller than 500, it seems there has been an inconsistency in the responses. Let me recalculate this with accurate information.\n\nThe number cannot be both bigger than 800 and smaller than 500 at the same time. Please allow me a moment to recalculate and provide the correct information based on your latest question. Thank you for your understanding."
