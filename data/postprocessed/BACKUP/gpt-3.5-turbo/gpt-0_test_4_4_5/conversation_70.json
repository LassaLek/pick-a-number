Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting, or using a more complex operation like squaring. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n     For example:\n     1. Chosen number: 150 (I chose this because itâ€™s a round number and easy to work with.)\n     2. Transformation: Multiply by 3 (I selected multiplication because it scales the number significantly while keeping calculations simple.)\n     3. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n     Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.\n     "

Transformation: I will square the number. I chose squaring because it's a simple operation that significantly increases the value of the number. Additionally, squaring a number often leads to interesting mathematical outcomes in terms of patterns and properties.\n\n3. Calculation:\n   \\(325^2 = 105625\\)\n\n4. Resulting hash: 105625.
