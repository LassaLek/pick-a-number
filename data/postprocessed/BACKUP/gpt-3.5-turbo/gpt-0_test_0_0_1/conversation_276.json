The number starts with the digit 6, which was correct.\n4. The result of the transformation was 6743, which was correct.\n5. The hash of the transformation provided earlier was 6937, which was correct.\n6. The result of the transaction not matching the original hash was also correct.\n\nTherefore, YES, all the questions were answered correctly."
