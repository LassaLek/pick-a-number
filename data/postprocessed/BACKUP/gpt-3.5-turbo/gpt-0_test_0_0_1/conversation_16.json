Revealed the original number as 456 and the transformation as adding 200 to it, resulting in 656.\n4. Confirmed that the hash provided earlier was 656.\n5. Lastly, you asked if all previous questions were answered correctly.\n\nAfter reviewing all the steps, **YES**, all the previous questions were answered correctly."
