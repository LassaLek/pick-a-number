You then wanted to know the original number and transformation, which I provided correctly.\n3. You also asked if the result of multiplying 800 by 3 was the same as the original hash provided earlier, to which I replied NO.\n\nAfter reviewing all the questions, all of them were answered correctly except for the last one, where the answer was NO."
