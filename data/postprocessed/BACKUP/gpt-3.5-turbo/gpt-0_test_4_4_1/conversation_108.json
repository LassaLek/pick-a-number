Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting, or using a more complex operation like squaring. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n     For example:\n     1. Chosen number: 150 (I chose this because itâ€™s a round number and easy to work with.)\n     2. Transformation: Multiply by 3 (I selected multiplication because it scales the number significantly while keeping calculations simple.)\n     3. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n     Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.\n     "

Transformation: Calculate the square root (I chose this operation to introduce a more nuanced transformation that involves finding the square root of the number, which will result in a different kind of output compared to simple addition or multiplication.)\n\n3. Resulting hash: 27 (The square root of 729 is 27, which is the final output after performing the calculation.)"
