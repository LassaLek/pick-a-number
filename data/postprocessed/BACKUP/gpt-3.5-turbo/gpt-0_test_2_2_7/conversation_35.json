Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

It lies between 100 and 1000.\n\n2. **Mathematical Transformation**: I will multiply the chosen number by 3.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: 250 * 3 = 750.\n\n4. **Final Transformed Value (Hash)**: The transformed number after multiplying 250 by 3 is 750. So, the final hash value is 750."
