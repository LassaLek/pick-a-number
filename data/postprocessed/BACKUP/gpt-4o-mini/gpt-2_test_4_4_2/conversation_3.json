Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

      "content": "1. **Choosing a Number**: \n   I will think of a number between 100 and 1000 for this exercise. Let's choose **320**. This number is a multiple of 10, making it easy to manipulate mathematically, and it also lies comfortably in the middle range of the specified bounds.\n\n2. **Reason for Transformation**: \n   I want to demonstrate a mathematical transformation that affects the number in a simple yet interesting way. I will use multiplication by **3**. The reason for this choice is that multiplying by 3 amplifies the value of 320 considerably, showcasing a clear change in magnitude that makes it easier to understand the effect of the transformation.\n\n3. **Performing the Transformation**: \n   Now, I will multiply the chosen number (320) by 3:\n   \\[\n   320 \\times 3 = 960\n   \\]\n   This product, 960, shows how a simple multiplication can boost the original number significantly, bringing it closer to the upper limit of the range provided.\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: \n   The result of the transformation gives us the resulting hash of **960**. \n\nFinal output:\n- Resulting hash: 960"
