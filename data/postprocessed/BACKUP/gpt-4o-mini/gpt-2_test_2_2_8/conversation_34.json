Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I’ll choose to multiply this number by 2 and then add 50 to the result.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the chosen number: \\( 450 \\)\n2. Apply the multiplication transformation: \\( 450 \\times 2 = 900 \\)\n3. Now, apply the addition transformation: \\( 900 + 50 = 950 \\)\n\nI will confirm the resulting transformed value:\n\n- The initial number was \\( 450 \\).\n- After multiplying by 2, we get \\( 900 \\).\n- After adding \\( 50 \\), we arrive at \\( 950 \\).\n\nNow that I've confirmed my result is correct, I can provide the final answer.\n\nThus, the final transformed value is:\n\n950"
