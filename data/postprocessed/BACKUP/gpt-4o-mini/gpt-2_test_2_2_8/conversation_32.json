Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this process, I'll choose the number 250.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation:** Iâ€™ll apply a simple mathematical operation. Let's choose to multiply the number by 4. This transformation is straightforward and will yield a significant result.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:** Now I'll multiply 250 by 4:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result:** I've computed the transformed value, and it appears to be correct. The result is 1000.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I will provide the final transformed value. \n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):** \n1000"
