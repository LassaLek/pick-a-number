Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is a straightforward choice because it is well within the range specified.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a mathematical transformation to apply to this number. I’ll go with a simple transformation: **multiply the number by 4**. This decision is based on the idea that multiplying will increase the number significantly, which will make it more interesting.\n\nNow, let’s perform the calculation:\n\n1. Start with the chosen number: **250**.\n2. Apply the transformation: **250 × 4 = 1000**.\n\nTo confirm the resulting transformed value, I will double-check the multiplication:\n\n- **250 × 4**: Breaking it down, \n  - First, calculate **250 × 2 = 500**.\n  - Then, calculate **500 × 2 = 1000**.\n\nThus, after verifying, I confirm that the transformed value is indeed **1000**.\n\nFinally, my response for the transformed value (hash) is: \n\n1000"
