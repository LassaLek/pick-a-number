Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the integer 345.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation:** I will apply a simple mathematical transformation: I will multiply the number by 3 and then add 25 to the result. This transformation is straightforward and will provide a clear final output.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation:** \n   - First, I multiply 345 by 3:\n     \\[\n     345 \\times 3 = 1035\n     \\]\n   - Then, I add 25 to the result:\n     \\[\n     1035 + 25 = 1060\n     \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the resulting transformed value:** The final result after applying the transformation to the number 345 is 1060. \n\nNow, I will provide the final transformed value.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 1060"
