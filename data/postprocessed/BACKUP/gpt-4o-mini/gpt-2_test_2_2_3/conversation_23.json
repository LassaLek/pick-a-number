Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This is well within the specified range.\n  \n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**: I'll apply a simple transformation. For this example, I will multiply the chosen number by 4.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will carry out the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Value**: The transformed value is 1000. \n\nNow, having completed my reasoning steps and confirmed the result:\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**: 1000"
