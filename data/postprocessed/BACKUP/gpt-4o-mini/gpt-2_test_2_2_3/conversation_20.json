Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose 250 as my number.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation**: I will choose a simple transformation. In this case, I will multiply the chosen number by 4.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: Now, I will perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the transformed value**: The result of the multiplication is indeed 1000, which is the transformed value from the original number (250).\n\nFollowing through with all the reasoning steps, the final transformed value (hash) is:\n\n1000"
