Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I chose this number because it is an odd number that is comfortably situated within the range of 100 to 1000, allowing for versatility in mathematical operations.\n\n2. **Applying a Transformation**: I will now apply a transformation by multiplying the number by 3. This transformation will significantly increase the value, as multiplying tends to expand the number rather than merely adjusting it.\n\n3. **Reason for Transformation**: I chose to multiply by 3 because I want to see how much larger the number can become and assess its characteristics in regards to being more prominent compared to the original number. This transformation should provide a clear insight into how scaling a number can affect its hash.\n\n4. **Calculating the Result**: \n   - Original number: 375\n   - Transformation: 375 × 3 = 1125\n\n5. **Final Step - Resulting Hash**: Now, since the final result of my transformation is 1125, I will provide the resulting hash.\n\n**Resulting hash: 1125**"
