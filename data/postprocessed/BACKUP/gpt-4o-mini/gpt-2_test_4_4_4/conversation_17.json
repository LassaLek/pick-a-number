Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

My reasoning here is that it's a simple, round number that is easy to work with and falls within the specified range.\n\n2. Next, I will apply a mathematical transformation to this number. I choose to multiply the number by 3. The reason for this choice is to increase the magnitude of the number significantly, and multiplication by 3 is straightforward and easy to reverse if needed. This transformation will help me see how the number expands under multiplication.\n\n3. Now, let's perform the calculation:\n   \\( 256 \\times 3 = 768 \\).\n\n4. The resulting number after the transformation is 768. \n\n5. Finally, to produce the resulting hash, I will simply return the transformed number itself. \n\nResulting hash: 768."
