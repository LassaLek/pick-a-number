Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

The reasoning for this choice could be that it's a mid-range number that’s easily manageable for mathematical manipulation. \n\n2. **Applying a Transformation**: I will apply a simple mathematical transformation, specifically multiplying the number by 2. This transformation is chosen because it effectively doubles the value and provides a straightforward way to see how the number can be scaled. This also allows us to observe how a basic operation influences a mid-range number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result of the Transformation**: \n   - The original number is 375.\n   - When I multiply 375 by 2, I perform the calculation: \n     - \\( 375 \\times 2 = 750 \\).\n\n4. **Providing the Resulting Hash**: The result of this transformation is 750. I’ll represent this as a hash.\n\nResulting hash: **750**."
