Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

A straightforward transformation could be to multiply the selected number by **4**.\n\nThe next step is to perform this multiplication:\n\n\\[\n250 \\times 4 = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that I have applied the transformation, I will confirm that the resulting transformed value is correctly calculated:\n\nThe transformed value, which is the result of multiplying 250 by 4, is indeed **1000**.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1000"
