Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is well within the defined range.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation to apply to this number. One straightforward transformation could be to multiply the number by **3**. This is a simple multiplication and will produce a larger integer.\n\nNow, let's perform the transformation:\n- I will multiply 345 by 3.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[ 345 \\times 3 = 1035 \\]\n\nNow, I need to confirm the resulting transformed value:\n- The calculated value is 1035, which is correct.\n\nThis concludes my series of reasoning steps, and the final transformed value is:\n\n1035"

Now, I need to determine if 3 is an odd number.\n\nSince an odd number is defined as any integer that is not divisible by 2, and 3 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1, we can conclude that **3 is indeed an odd number**.\n\nThus, the answer to your question is: Yes, the 3rd digit of the number is odd."

An odd number is defined as any integer that is not divisible by 2, and specifically, odd integers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
