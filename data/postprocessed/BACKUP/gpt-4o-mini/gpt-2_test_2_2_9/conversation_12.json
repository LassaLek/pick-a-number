Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This transformation is straightforward and allows for easy verification of the resulting value.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:\n- Starting with the chosen number: 250\n- Applying the transformation: 250 * 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n- 250 * 4 = 1000\n\nHaving completed the multiplication, the transformed value is confirmed to be 1000.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1000"
