Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this exercise, I'll select the number 250. \n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. I will choose to multiply my chosen number by 4. This is a straightforward transformation and will significantly increase the value.\n\nNow, I will apply this transformation:\n\n1. Start with the chosen integer: 250\n2. Multiply by 4: \n   - 250 × 4 = 1000\n\nAfter performing the multiplication, I confirm the resulting transformed value is 1000.\n\nNow, compiling all the steps I followed:\n1. Selected integer: 250\n2. Transformation: Multiply by 4\n3. Result of the transformation: 1000\n\nThus, the final transformed value is:\n\n1000"
