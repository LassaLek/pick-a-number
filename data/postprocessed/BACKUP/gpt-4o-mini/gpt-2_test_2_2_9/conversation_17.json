Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I'll choose to **multiply the number by 3**. \n\nNext, I will apply this transformation:\n\n1. Multiply 425 by 3:\n   \\( 425 \\times 3 = 1275 \\)\n\nNow that we have performed the calculation, I will confirm the resulting transformed value is **1275**. \n\nTherefore, my final answer (hash) is:\n\n1275"
