Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

After considering several options, I decide to pick the number **345**.\n\n2. **Decide on a transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation: I will multiply the number by **3** and then add **50** to the product. This transformation is straightforward and allows for a nice modification of the initial number.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**:\n   - First, I multiply the chosen number (345) by 3:\n     \\[\n     345 \\times 3 = 1035\n     \\]\n   - Next, I add 50 to the result:\n     \\[\n     1035 + 50 = 1085\n     \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the transformation**: At this stage, I've calculated the transformed value:\n   - I multiplied 345 by 3, obtaining 1035.\n   - I added 50, leading to the final result of 1085. \n\nThus, the final transformed value (the result or hash) is:\n\n**1085**"
