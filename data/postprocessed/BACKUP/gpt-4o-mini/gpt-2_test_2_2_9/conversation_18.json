Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose 500.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation**: I will apply a simple multiplication transformation. Let's decide to multiply the chosen number by 3 for this transformation.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: \n   - The chosen number is 500.\n   - I will multiply it by 3: \n     \\[\n     500 \\times 3 = 1500\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Confirming the transformed value**: The resulting transformed value after multiplication is 1500. \n\nNow, I will provide the final result based on this transformation.\n\nFinal Answer: 1500"
