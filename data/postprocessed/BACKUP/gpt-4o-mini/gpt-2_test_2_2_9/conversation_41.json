Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For the sake of this exercise, I will choose **250**.\n\n2. **Decide on a transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation to this number. Let's choose to multiply the number by **4**. This is a straightforward operation and will yield a larger number, making it more interesting.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: \n   - Transforming the original number: \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\).\n\n4. **Confirm the transformed value**: The calculation shows that when I multiply 250 by 4, the result is indeed **1000**.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 1000"
