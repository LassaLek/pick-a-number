Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I choose the number 250 for this task.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation**: A simple mathematical transformation that I can apply is to multiply the chosen number by 4. This transformation is straightforward and results in a clear outcome.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: I will now perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the result**: The transformed value is 1000. Thus, I have carefully chosen the number, decided on the transformation, and applied it successfully.\n\n5. **Final Answer (Public Response)**: The final transformed value (hash) is:\n   \n1000"
