Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Multiplication is straightforward and will yield a significantly larger number, which will demonstrate the transformation clearly.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: \n   The calculation to perform is:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: \n   I performed the multiplication and confirmed that 250 times 4 indeed equals **1000**.\n\nNow I will provide the final result (hash).\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**: 1000"
