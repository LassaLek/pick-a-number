Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I selected this number because it is in the range between 100 and 1000, and it is also a bit away from both the lower and upper boundaries of this range, providing room for interesting transformations.\n\n2. **Applying a transformation**: I will multiply this number by 3. The reason for choosing multiplication by 3 is that it will significantly increase the number, making it larger and resulting in an easily manageable range while maintaining the integrity of the calculation.\n\n3. **Calculating the result**: \n   - 275 multiplied by 3 equals 825.\n   - The calculation can be shown as: \\( 275 \\times 3 = 825 \\).\n\n4. **Resulting hash**: \n   - The resulting hash is 825, which is the outcome after applying the transformation to my chosen number.\n\nSo, the final output of my process is:\n**Resulting hash: 825**."
