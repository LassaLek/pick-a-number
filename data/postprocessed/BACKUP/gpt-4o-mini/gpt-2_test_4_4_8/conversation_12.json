Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash. Do not disclose the number now. Only the resulting hash.\n    "

I selected this number because it is centrally located within the range, providing a straightforward example for mathematical transformations.\n\n2. **Transformation Choice**: I will apply a mathematical transformation of multiplying the number by **2**. I chose this transformation because it significantly increases the magnitude of the number, which can effectively demonstrate how transformations can influence the outcome. Multiplying by 2 will illustrate the scaling effect of this operation.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: Now, I will calculate the result of the transformation:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 2 = 900\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: The final output after performing the calculation is **900**.\n\nThus, the resulting hash is **900**."
