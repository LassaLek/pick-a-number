Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

After considering the range, I will choose 500.\n\n2. **Decide on a mathematical transformation**: A straightforward transformation could be to multiply by a constant. Iâ€™ll choose to multiply by 3 for simplicity.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: I now multiply the chosen number (500) by the decided constant (3):\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 3 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: I confirmed my calculation: multiplying 500 by 3 indeed gives me 1500.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed value (hash) is:\n\n1500"
