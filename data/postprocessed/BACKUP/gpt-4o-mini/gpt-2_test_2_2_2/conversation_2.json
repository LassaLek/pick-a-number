Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number meets the criteria as it is within the specified range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: \n   Next, I will decide on a simple mathematical transformation. For this exercise, I will choose to multiply the number by 3.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: \n   Now, I will apply the transformation to my chosen number:\n   - Multiply 487 by 3:\n     \\[\n     487 \\times 3 = 1461\n     \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: \n   I will confirm that the result of the multiplication is correct:\n   - Performing the multiplication:\n     - \\(487 \\times 3 = 1461\\)\n\nThe resulting transformed value has been verified as correct.\n\nNow, I will provide the final transformed value. \n\nFinal Answer: 1461"
