Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the number **250**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation:** I want to apply a simple transformation. In this case, let's decide to multiply the number by **4**.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - Starting with 250, I will multiply it by 4.\n   - So, the calculation is: \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\).\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Value:** The transformed value after performing the multiplication is **1000**.\n\nNow, following the instructions, I will provide the final transformed value.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):** 1000"
