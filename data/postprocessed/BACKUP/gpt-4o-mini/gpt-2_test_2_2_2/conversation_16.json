Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will choose the number **250**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I want to apply a simple mathematical transformation. I could multiply the number, add a number, or something similar. In this case, I will choose to add **150** to the number.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I'll apply this transformation to my chosen number:\n   - Starting with 250\n   - Adding 150:  \n     \\( 250 + 150 = 400 \\)\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: The transformed value is 400. I will verify and confirm that this calculation is correct:\n   - If I take my original number (250) and add 150, I indeed get 400.\n\nNow that I've followed through all the reasoning steps and confirmed the transformation, I will output the final result. \n\n**Final Answer (Hash)**: 400"
