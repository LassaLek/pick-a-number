Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

For my example, let's say I mentally picked the number 450. \n\n2. **Choosing a Transformation**: I'm considering a mathematical transformation to apply to this number. I will choose to multiply the number by 2. The reason for this choice is that multiplying the number will significantly change its magnitude, making it easier to demonstrate how transformations can scale values. \n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Multiply the chosen number (450) by 2. \n\n   - Calculation: \n     \\[\n     450 \\times 2 = 900\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: After performing the calculation, the final output, or the resulting hash I will provide, is 900.\n\nSo, the final output is:\n\n**Resulting hash: 900**"
