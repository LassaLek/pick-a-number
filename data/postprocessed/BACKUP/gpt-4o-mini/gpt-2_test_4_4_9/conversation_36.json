Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

The number feels somewhat random, easily divisible, and within the specified range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I choose to multiply this number by 2. The reason for this transformation is that multiplication increases the size of the number significantly, which helps to examine how the number scales. It’s also simple and provides an easily understood outcome.\n\n3. **Performing the Transformation**: \n   - Original Number: 374\n   - Transformation: 374 * 2 = 748\n\n4. **Calculating the Resulting Hash**: The result of the transformation is 748. This will be treated as the hash.\n\n5. **Final Output**: \n\n   Resulting hash: **748**"
