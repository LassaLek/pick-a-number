Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will select the number **250**.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation to apply to this number. A straightforward choice would be to multiply it by **4**. Multiplication is a simple and effective transformation that will change the scale of the number.\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n1. Start with the chosen number: **250**.\n2. Apply the transformation: **250 × 4 = 1000**.\n\nNow, I will confirm the resulting transformed value:\n\n- The multiplication of **250** and **4** gives **1000**, which I've calculated correctly.\n\nFinally, I will give you the transformed value (hash):\n\n**1000**"
