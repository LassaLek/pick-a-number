Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is within the specified range and provides a moderate starting point for calculations.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation:** \n   For my transformation, I will choose to multiply the number by **3**. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation that will increase the value.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:** \n   Now I will apply the transformation to my chosen number:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:** \n   I perform the multiplication:\n   - Calculate: \\( 3 \\times 350 \\).\n   - Break it down: \\( 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\) and \\( 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\).\n   - Add those together: \\( 900 + 150 = 1050 \\).\n   Thus, the transformed value is confirmed as **1050**.\n\nNow, I will provide the final result (hash).\n\nFinal Answer: 1050"
