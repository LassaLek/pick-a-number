Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this exercise, I will choose the number **500**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I need to apply a simple mathematical transformation to the chosen number. I will choose to **multiply the number by 3**. This is a straightforward transformation that gives a larger output.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now I multiply the chosen number (500) by 3:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 3 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value**: After performing the multiplication, I get the result of **1500**. I will ensure this multiplication is accurate:\n   - Verification: \\(500 \\times 3\\) indeed equals \\(1500\\).\n\nIn conclusion, after going through all the reasoning steps and calculations, the final transformed value (hash) is:\n\n1500"
