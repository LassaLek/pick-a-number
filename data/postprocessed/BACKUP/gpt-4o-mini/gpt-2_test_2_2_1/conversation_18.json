Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will choose **350**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**: I will choose a simple transformation. Let's choose to multiply the number by **3**. This is a straightforward transformation that will scale the number up.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will apply the transformation. \n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: I have calculated that multiplying 350 by 3 results in 1050. This is the transformed value.\n\nNow, I will provide the final transformed value as requested.\n\n**Final Result (Hash)**: 1050"
