Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will apply a transformation by multiplying the chosen number by 3.\n\nNow, I will calculate the transformation:\n- Multiply 350 by 3:\n  \\( 350 \\times 3 = 1050 \\)\n\nNext, I need to confirm the resulting transformed value. The calculation shows that the result of multiplying 350 by 3 is indeed 1050.\n\nNow, I will provide the final result (hash) value based on my calculations.\n\nFinal Answer: 1050"
