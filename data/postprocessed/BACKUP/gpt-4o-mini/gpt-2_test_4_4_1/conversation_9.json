Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I selected this number because it is a mid-range value that is easy to work with and provides a good example of the process.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation by multiplying the chosen number by 2. I chose multiplication because it will significantly increase the value, providing a clear demonstration of how transformations can alter a number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result of the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the chosen number: 456.\n   - Multiply it by 2: \n     \\[\n     456 \\times 2 = 912\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: After completing the calculation, the resulting value is 912.\n\n5. **Final Output**: The resulting hash is 912.\n\nIn summary, I started with the number 456, applied a multiplication transformation by 2, which gave me a final output hash of 912."
