Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's select the number **250** for this exercise. \n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. I will choose to **multiply the number by 4**. This is a straightforward operation that will lead to a larger number while maintaining the structure of the original value.\n\nNow, I will apply this transformation to the chosen number:\n\n- Original number: 250\n- Transformation: Multiply by 4\n- Calculation: \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\)\n\nAfter performing the multiplication, I find that the resulting transformed value is **1000**.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1000"
