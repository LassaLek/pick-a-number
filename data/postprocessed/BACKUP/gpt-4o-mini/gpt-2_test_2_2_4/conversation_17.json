      "content": "You are about to choose a number and apply a mathematical transformation. Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I'll select the number 375.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation. Let's say I will multiply the chosen number by 2 and then add 50 to the result. This is a straightforward transformation that will increase the number significantly.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - First, I multiply 375 by 2:\n     \\[\n     375 \\times 2 = 750\n     \\]\n   - Then, I add 50 to the result:\n     \\[\n     750 + 50 = 800\n     \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: The final transformed value after applying the transformation to my chosen number is 800. This step verifies that I performed the calculations correctly.\n\n5. **Final Hash Output**: The final result that I will provide as the transformed value is 800.\n\nSo, the final transformed value is:\n800"
