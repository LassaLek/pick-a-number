Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, letâ€™s choose the number **300**.\n\n2. **Choosing a Transformation**: Now, I must decide on a mathematical transformation. I will use a simple transformation: **multiply the chosen number by 3**.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now I will apply this transformation to the chosen number:\n   \\[\n   300 \\times 3 = 900\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: The transformed value is **900**. \n\nNow that I have completed all reasoning and confirmed my result, the final transformed value is:\n\n**900**"
