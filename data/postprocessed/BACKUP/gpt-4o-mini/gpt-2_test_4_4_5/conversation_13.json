Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

For the sake of this exercise, I will randomly select the number 625. This number is chosen because it is in the middle range of 100 to 1000, which provides a good balance for transformation.\n\n2. **Choosing a mathematical transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation by subtracting 200 from the number. I chose this transformation because it will decrease the number significantly but still keep it above 0, ensuring that we stay within a reasonable range for any further calculations.\n\n3. **Calculating the result**: \n   - Start with: 625\n   - Apply the transformation: 625 - 200 = 425\n\n4. **Creating a hash**: For this example, let's define the hash as the final calculated number itself since we are not using a standard hashing algorithm. Thus, the resulting hash will be the number we calculated.\n\nResulting hash: **425**"
