I chose this number because it's a perfect square (16^2) and lies comfortably within the specified range.\n\n2. **Transformation**: I will apply a simple mathematical transformation by multiplying my chosen number by 3. I selected multiplication for this transformation because it amplifies the value, making the resulting number notably larger, which could be interesting for further calculations or hashing.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: \n   \\[\n   256 \\times 3 = 768\n   \\]\n   Here, the base number 256 is increased by a factor of 3 through multiplication, resulting in 768.\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: The final output, which is the result of the transformation, is 768. \n\nThus, the resulting hash is **768**."
