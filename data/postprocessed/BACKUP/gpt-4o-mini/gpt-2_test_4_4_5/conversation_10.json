I’ll choose 345, as it's an arbitrary yet balanced number within that range—far enough from either limit (100 and 1000).\n\n2. **Choosing the Transformation**: I will perform a multiplication transformation on this number. Specifically, I’ll multiply it by 2. I chose multiplication because it scales the number up, making it larger and thus may further analyze its properties or uses in applied scenarios.\n\n3. **Calculating the Transformation**: \n   - I take my chosen number, which is 345.\n   - I multiply it by 2: \n     \\[\n     345 \\times 2 = 690\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: \n   Now, the transformation has been applied successfully, and the resulting hash is:\n   - **Resulting hash: 690** (This is the final output after performing the calculation.) \n\nThe hash of 690 clearly indicates the result of the transformation applied to my chosen number."
