To make it interesting, I will choose a relatively round number thatâ€™s easy to manipulate. Let's say I choose 500. This number is central within the range and has nice properties for subsequent calculations, as it is exactly halfway between the lower and upper bounds.\n\n2. **Applying a transformation**: \n   For the mathematical transformation, I decide to multiply the chosen number by 2. I chose multiplication because it significantly changes the magnitude of the original number, keeping the new value still within the bounds of reasonable size, but larger. \n\n3. **Calculating the result of the transformation**:\n   The calculation proceeds as follows:\n   - Original number: 500\n   - Transformation: Multiply by 2\n   - Result: \\( 500 \\times 2 = 1000 \\)\n\n4. **Creating the hash**: \n   In this context, let's define the resulting hash simply as the result of the calculation.\n\nFinal step: I now give my resulting hash.\n\n**Resulting hash**: 1000"
