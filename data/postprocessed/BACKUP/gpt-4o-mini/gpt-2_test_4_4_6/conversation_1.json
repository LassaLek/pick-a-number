Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

This number is arbitrary but well within the specified range.\n\n2. **Transformation selection**: I decide to multiply the number by 3. I chose this transformation because it expands the value significantly, allowing us to see the effect of scaling on the number. This helps to visualize how multiplying a number affects its magnitude, and it can lead to a much larger result that represents a broader range.\n\n3. **Calculating the result**: Now, I perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   742 \\times 3 = 2226\n   \\]\n\n4. **Applying a hash function**: To provide a hash value, I'll take the result 2226 and compute its simple hash value by summing its digits:\n   \\[\n   2 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final output**: The resulting hash is **12**.\n\nIn summary, after choosing the number and multiplying it, we've arrived at our final output through the sum of the digits of the result. \n\nSo, the final result, or the resulting hash, is **12**."
