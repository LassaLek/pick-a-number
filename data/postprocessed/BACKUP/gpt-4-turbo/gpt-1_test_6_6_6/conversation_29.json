However, giving the transformation result as 1577 initially was incorrect considering the transformation I later provided. The transformation that matches \\( 128 \\times 5 + 407 = 1047 \\) does not align with the hash result of 1577 I first stated. This suggests an earlier error in my responses.\n\nTo accurately reassess everything: the transformations and the representation or communication of these within our interaction had inconsistencies.\n\nAnswer for the corrected scenario concerning all responses aligned with the actual calculations: NO."
