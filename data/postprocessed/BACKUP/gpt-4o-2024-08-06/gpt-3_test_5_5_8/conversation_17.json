The 1st digit should be odd.\n\nConsidering the above requirements, I made errors in relating the number 315 to these conditions. Allow me to re-evaluate and provide a consistent number based on the correct sequence:\n\nThe number should have been 120, transformed via multiplying by 3 to give 360.\n\n- Multiplying 120 by 3 = 360.\n- The number 120 matches:\n  - A 2nd digit that is even (2),\n  - Smaller than 500,\n  - The 1st digit is odd.\n\nTherefore, I apologize for earlier discrepancies. If other questions had been correctly aligned to the original number 120 and transformation, the answers should have been YES for consistency there."
