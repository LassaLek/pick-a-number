However, based on your question, it seems there was a discrepancy in how I first described the number because 256 is not smaller than 200.\n\nSince you want a number smaller than 200, I'll choose the number 128 instead, remembering that you need a revised version to be accurate:\n\nNumber: 128\n\nTransformation: Multiply by 4, then add 100.\n\nCalculation: (128 * 4) + 100 = 612\n\nThe original described hash was incorrect for a number smaller than 200 as well.\n\nUpdated hash using the correct number 128 is 612.\n\nThe transformation on the revised number 128 gives the result 612, which matches the revised hash.\n\nSince I'm unable to confirm the original number and transformation's consistency, the answer was NO for the setup."
