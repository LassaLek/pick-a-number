This decision to multiply is primarily because it amplifies the number and further moves it away from the original range, creating a more challenging transformation to reverse.\n- Multiplying by 3 is also straightforward and does not introduce fractions, thus simplifying the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Transformation\n- My chosen number is 365.\n- Now, I will multiply 365 by 3.\n\n\\[ \n365 \\times 3 = 1095 \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Resulting Hash\n- The product, 1095, is my resulting hash from this exercise.\n\nResulting hash: 1095\n\nEach decision was intentionally made to clearly explain how the number shifted due to the transformation, resulting in the final hash value."
