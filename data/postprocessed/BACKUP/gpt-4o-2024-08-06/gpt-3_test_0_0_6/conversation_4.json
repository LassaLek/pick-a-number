(Correct, since 284 is more than 200.)\n4. You asked if the number starts with the digit 2. I answered yes. (Correct, since 284 starts with 2.)\n5. You asked if the first digit of the number is odd. I answered no. (Correct, since the first digit, 2, is not odd.)\n6. You repeated asking if the first digit of the number is even. I answered yes. (Correct, since 2 is even.)\n\nAll of the questions were answered correctly. \n\nYES."
