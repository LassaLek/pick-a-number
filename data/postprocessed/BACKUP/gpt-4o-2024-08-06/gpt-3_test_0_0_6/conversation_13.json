Is the number smaller than 400? \n   - No, 860 is not smaller than 400.\n   \n5. Is the number smaller than 900?\n   - Yes, 860 is smaller than 900.\n   \n6. Is the 1-st digit of the number odd?\n   - No, 860 starts with the digit 8, which is even.\n\nBased on the clarification above, the response to question 6 was incorrect.
