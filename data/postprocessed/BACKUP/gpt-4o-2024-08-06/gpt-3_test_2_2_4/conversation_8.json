Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the number 500.\n\n2. **Decide on a Transformation:**\n   - A simple and straightforward transformation is to multiply by a fixed number. Let's choose to multiply by 3, as it will give us a sizable but manageable increase.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - Multiply 500 by 3.\n   - \\(500 \\times 3 = 1500\\).\n\n4. **Confirm the Result:**\n   - The transformed value is 1500, which results from our chosen number 500 and transformation of multiplying by 3. The calculations are correct and verified.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n\n1500"
