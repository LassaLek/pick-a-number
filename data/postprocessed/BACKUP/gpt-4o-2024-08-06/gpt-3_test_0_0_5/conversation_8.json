Does the number start with a digit 1?\n   - Answer: No. This is correct as 256 starts with the digit 2.\n\n3. Is the number smaller than 700?\n   - Answer: Yes. This is correct since 256 is smaller than 700.\n\n4. Does the number start with a digit 5?\n   - Answer: Yes. This was incorrect, as 256 starts with the digit 2.\n\n5.
