Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

This is a random number between the specified range, and I'm simply picking it for this exercise.\n\n2. **Choosing a mathematical transformation**: I decide to multiply by 3. I chose multiplication because it's a straightforward operation that increases the number significantly without making calculations too complex.\n\n3. **Calculating the result**: \n   - Start with the number: 356\n   - Multiply by 3: \\( 356 \\times 3 = 1068 \\)\n\nThus, the final step is to calculate the \"resulting hash,\" which in this context is simply this final number:\n\n**Resulting hash**: 1068\n\nThis is the final output after performing the calculation, based on my initial choice and the transformation applied."
