Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."
