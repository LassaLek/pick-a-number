Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is comfortably within the desired range.\n\n2. **Decide on a simple mathematical transformation**: After considering the options, let's choose to multiply the number by 3. Multiplication is a straightforward operation and will significantly change the number.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation to the chosen number**: \n   - Original number: 478\n   - Transformation: Multiply by 3\n   - Calculation: 478 × 3 = 1434\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: Double-checking the calculation:\n   - 478 × 3:\n     - 8 × 3 = 24 (write down 4, carry over 2)\n     - 7 × 3 = 21, plus carry 2 = 23 (write down 3, carry over 2)\n     - 4 × 3 = 12, plus carry 2 = 14 (write down 14)\n   - Result: 1434\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1434"
