Is the 2nd digit of the number odd? \n   - Yes, 4 is even, which means my response was incorrect; it should have been \"No.\"\n\n4. Is the number bigger than 300? \n   - Yes, 549 is bigger than 300.\n\n5. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd? \n   - No, 9 is odd, which means my response was incorrect; it should have been \"Yes.\"\n\n6. Is the 1st digit of the number odd?\n   - Yes, 5 is odd.\n\n7. Does the number start with a digit 1? \n   - No, 549 starts with 5.\n\n8. Is the number bigger than 400? \n   - Yes, 549 is bigger than 400.\n\nSo, I made errors on questions 3 and 5. I apologize for the mistakes. The answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is therefore:\n\nNO."
