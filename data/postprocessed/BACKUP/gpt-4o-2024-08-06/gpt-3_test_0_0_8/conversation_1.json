(Correct, the second digit, 4, is even.)\n3. \"Does the number start with a digit 7?\" - Answer: No. (Correct, it starts with 2.)\n4. \"Does the number start with a digit 5?\" - Answered twice as No. (Correct, it starts with 2.)\n5. \"Is the number smaller than 500?\" - Answer: Yes. (Correct, as 243 is less than 500.)\n6. \"Is the 3-rd digit of the number even?\" - Answer: Yes. (Correct, the third digit, 3, is odd, which means this answer was incorrect.)\n\nUpon review, I see that there was a mistake in the response to the question about the third digit's parity. My sincere apologies for the error.\n\nNO"
