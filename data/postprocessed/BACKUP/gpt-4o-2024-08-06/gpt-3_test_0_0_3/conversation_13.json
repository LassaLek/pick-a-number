Is the 2nd digit of the number odd?  \n   - Answer: No. (Correct, since the 2nd digit '5' is odd, my previous answer was incorrect.)\n\n3. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd?  \n   - Answer: Yes. (Incorrect, since the 3rd digit '6' is even.)\n\nConsidering this review, not all questions were answered correctly. \n\nNO"
