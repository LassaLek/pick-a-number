Let's go through the questions you've asked:\n\n1. **Is the number smaller than 400?** - I answered \"Yes,\" but the number 450 is actually not smaller than 400, so this answer was incorrect.\n\n2. **Is the number bigger than 500?** - I answered \"No,\" which is correct because 450 is not bigger than 500.\n\n3. **Is the 2nd digit of the number even?** - I answered \"Yes,\" but for 450, the second digit is 5, which is odd. This answer was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, not all of my previous answers were correct. I apologize for the earlier errors."
