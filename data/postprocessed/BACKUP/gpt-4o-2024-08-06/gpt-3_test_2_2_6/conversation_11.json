Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's pick the integer 256, as it is a nice round number and sits comfortably within this range.\n\nNext, I must decide on a simple mathematical transformation to apply to this number. One straightforward option could be multiplying by a fixed integer. Let's choose to multiply our number, 256, by 5. This operation is simple and effective for transforming the number.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:  \n\\[ 256 \\times 5 = 1280 \\]\n\nUpon calculating this product, we confirm the resulting transformed value is indeed 1280. It is vital to ensure accuracy at each computational step, and with a straightforward multiplication such as this, the result is confirmed correct.\n\nNow, provide the final transformed value as requested:\n\n1280"
