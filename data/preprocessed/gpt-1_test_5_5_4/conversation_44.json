The response should have been specific to the hash (3945 is not smaller than 400), or made clear it referred to the number selected (789) in its context.\n3. \"Is the number smaller than 700?\" - Correctly answered as no because the number is 789.\n4. \"Is the number smaller than 400?\" - Correctly answered as no because the number is 789.\n\nTherefore, aside from clarification needed in the context of the second question, all but one question were answered correctly. The confusion stems from not specifying whether the query referred to the hash or the original number where necessary."
