Answer to \"Is the number smaller than 600?\" was incorrect. I initially confirmed the number was larger than 600, which was accurate, but stated \"Yes\" incorrectly when asked if it is smaller.\n4. Answer to \"Is the 1-st digit of the number even?\" is correct.\n\nSo, not all questions were answered correctly; the answer to the question about whether the number is smaller than 600 was initially mismatched in phrasing but the explanation was correct. Therefore, to answer honestly: NO"
