I incorrectly mentioned it as being even when the question specifically asked if it was odd.\n3. **Is the number smaller than 100?** - You asked about the original number 782, and I correctly responded that it was not smaller than 100.\n4. **Is the number bigger than 600?** - Regarding 782, I correctly confirmed that it is bigger than 600.\n\nExcept for the mistake about the second digit being odd, all other responses were correct. The error lies in my incorrect statement regarding the second digit of the number (the digit is even and not odd as mistakenly affirmed due to the phrasing of the question). Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nAnswer: NO."
