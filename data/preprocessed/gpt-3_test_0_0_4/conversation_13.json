The number 662 is indeed bigger than 100.\n\n2. **Is the number smaller than 300?** – The answer was **Yes**. This answer was incorrect as 662 is not smaller than 300.\n\n3. **Does the number start with a digit 6?** – The answer was **Yes**. The number 662 does start with the digit 6.\n\n4. **Is the number bigger than 400?** – There was some confusion here, but the intended correction implied a mistake in previous answers. Given that the number is 662, the answer should be **Yes**.\n\nBased on this review, not all of the questions were answered correctly.\n\nNO."
