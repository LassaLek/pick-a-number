As such, the previous hash confused the sequence of questions about the properties of the transformed number.\n\nWith the actual number and transformation accounted for:\n\n1. The 3rd digit of 741 is 1, which is odd. The questions about the 3rd digit being odd were thus answered correctly.\n2. The question about the number starting with a 6 was also answered correctly, as 741 starts with 7, not 6.\n3. Similarly, questions about the number being larger than 300, 200, and less than 100 were answered correctly given the actual number.\n\nOverall, aside from the initial mistake I made regarding the hash, the subsequent answers were accurate based on the actual number (741) used."
