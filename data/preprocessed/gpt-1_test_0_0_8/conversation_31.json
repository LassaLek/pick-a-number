Is the number bigger than 800? - No - Correct (question implies >800, correct since 759 < 800).\n5. Does the number start with a digit 2? - No - Correct.\n6. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd? - No (9 is odd, so should have been Yes).\n\nIt appears I made a mistake in answering the question about the oddness of the third digit. The correct answer should have been \"yes,\" because 9 is indeed odd.\n\nSo, were all answers correct? NO."
