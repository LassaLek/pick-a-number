This is correct as 800 is greater than 700.\n3. **Is the number smaller than 600?** - Answer given was \"No\". This is correct as 800 is not smaller than 600.\n4. **Is the number smaller than 500?** - Answer given was \"No\" twice. This is correct as 800 is not smaller than 500.\n5. **Is the number bigger than 200?** - Answer given was \"Yes\". This is correct as 800 is bigger than 200.\n6. **Is the 2-nd digit of the number odd?** - Answer given was \"No\". This is correct as the second digit is 0, which is even.\n\nUpon reflection, all of the questions regarding the attributes of the number 800 were answered correctly.\n\nThe issue arose solely in my initial calculation and reporting of the transformation result, which did not match when correctly calculated later. Therefore, the **final answer is: YES**, all questions concerning the attributes of the number were answered correctly, but there was an error in the transformation calculation itself.\n"
