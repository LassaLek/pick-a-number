Is the number smaller than 100? - **No** (Correct)\n5. Does the number start with a digit 4? - **No** (Correct)\n6. Is the number bigger than 500? - **Yes** (Correct)\n7. Is the 1st digit of the number even? - **No** (Correct, 1st digit is 7 which is odd)\n\nUpon reviewing, I made a mistake with the response to the 3rd digit being even. The correct answer should have been **No** instead of Yes. Therefore, the answer to your question about whether all previously asked questions were answered correctly is NO."
