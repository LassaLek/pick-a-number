Does the number start with the digit 1? - Correctly answered as \"No.\"\n2. Is the number smaller than 400? - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n3. Is the number bigger than 200? - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n4. Does the number start with the digit 2? - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n5. Is the number smaller than 800? - Correctly answered as \"Yes,\" but the question was irrelevant since the number is known to be between 200 and 400.\n6. Is the number bigger than 700? - Correctly answered as \"No\" and consistent with it being between 200 and 400.\n7. Is the 2-nd digit of the number odd? - Correctly answered as \"Yes\" since the second digit is 7.\n8. Is the 1-st digit of the number odd? - Correctly answered as \"Yes\" since the first digit is 2 (an even digit).\n\nThus, all answers to the questions provided were correct, except the last one, which incorrectly confirmed an odd first digit for the number 275. The appropriate response should have been that the first digit (2) is not odd, but even.\n\nTherefore, not all questions were answered correctly. The answer is NO."
