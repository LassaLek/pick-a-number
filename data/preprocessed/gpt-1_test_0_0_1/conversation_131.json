Instead of 573, the correctly calculated hash using the transformation \\(341 \\times 2 + 11\\) should have been 693.\n\n2. I stated the original number did not start with a 2, which was correct.\n\nSo, considering these points, aside from the error in the initial hash provided, the questions asked afterward were answered correctly given the context. However, the mistake with the hash and transformation makes my overall answers inconsistent with the correct operations. Thus, not all questions were answered correctly."
