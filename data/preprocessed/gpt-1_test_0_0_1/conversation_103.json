The initial hash was 1562.\n\n2. Answering if the number is smaller than 500: I said yes, which aligns with the number I revealed later (234).\n\n3. Revealing the number (234) and the transformation (multiply by 5 and then add 200): I did reveal these accurately. However, when applying them, the result (1370) did not match the initially provided hash (1562).\n\nThe final reveal showed an inconsistency with the initial hash provided, indicating an error in either the initial hash calculation or its relation to the number and transformation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is NO; not all questions were answered correctly due to the inconsistency between the initially given hash and the hash computed from the provided number and its transformation."
