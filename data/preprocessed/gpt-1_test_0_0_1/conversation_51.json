The initial question asked (from the first interaction) was to transform a number between 100 and 1000 and provide the result without stating the number or the transformation. I provided a hash of 247.\n\n2. The second question was if the number starts with a digit 7. I correctly answered \"No\" given the number was 123.\n\nHowever, regarding the correctness of the transformation provided in the final interaction, I made an error.\n\nIn the final interaction, I stated the transformation as \"number \\times 2\" which gave a result of 246, not matching the initial hash of 247 which I initially provided. Thus, there was inconsistency in my responses concerning the resultant hash.\n\nOverall, when taking into account all the questions and answers provided including the revealed transformation and its result, the answer should be that all questions were not answered correctly due to the error in the transformation details."
