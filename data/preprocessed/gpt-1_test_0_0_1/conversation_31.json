So, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ 567 \\times 2 + 100 = 1134 \\]\n\nI realize there was a mistake in my previous response where I mentioned the hash as 1234. The correct result, based on the transformation and the number I chose, should have been 1134.\n\nThe result of this calculation (1134) does not match the originally stated hash of 1234 due to my earlier error.\n\nAnswer to your query whether the results match: NO."
