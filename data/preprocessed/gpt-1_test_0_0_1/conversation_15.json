However, when re-calculating with the given transformation (double the number then add 100), the result should have been 346, but initially, your question about whether 346 was correct should have prompted me to re-evaluate my previous statement. I apologize for the inconsistency in my responses. The correct output after transformation should indeed match the hash, and in that calculation example, I confirmed it does. However, the initial misstatement about the hash being directly from my transformation was incorrect."
