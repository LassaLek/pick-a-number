Upon reviewing, I discovered an error: I previously stated that my original thought number did not start with the digit '2', which was consistent with the number 435 (which indeed does not start with the digit '2'). However, any confirmation or indication about the starting digit was wrongly confirmed or denied based on the specific transformations not being affected by the starting digit in this case. Thus, the validation of my answers was consistent but might have been confusing in the context provided."
