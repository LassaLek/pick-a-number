After reevaluating the transformation stated and applying the transformation to the number provided (836 multiplied by 1.7366 giving approximately 1452), it contradicts the statement that the number is not smaller than 600, given the nature of the question's broad possibilities and my initial response confirmed the number was greater than 600, which hints at a direct contradiction or error."
