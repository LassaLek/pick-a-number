I provided a hash value.\n2. **Second response**: You asked if the number was smaller than 400, and I confirmed that it was.\n3. **Third response**: You asked to reveal the original number and the transformation, and I provided that information. However, the calculation and the initial hash given (1218) did not match when I applied the transformation to the remembered number (resulting in 1146 instead of 1218). This inconsistency indicates an error.\n\nBased on the discrepancy noted in the calculation of the initial hash, I must conclude that my initial hash value provided in the first response was incorrect. Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly."
