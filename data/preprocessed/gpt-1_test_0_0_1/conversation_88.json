I initially provided a hash of 2137 but later revealed that the original number was 123 and applied a simple transformation of multiplying by 17, resulting in a value different from the initially stated hash.\n2. I stated the 2nd digit of the number (which is 2 in 123) is even, which is correct.\n\nBased on these points, the question about the hash result compared to the original number and transformation was not answered correctly initially. Hence, not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nSo, the answer to this question is NO."
