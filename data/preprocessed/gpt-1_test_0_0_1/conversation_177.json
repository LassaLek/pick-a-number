However, the initial transformation I described (multiplying by 2 and adding 582) did not match the result provided as 1452 if the number was actually 435. Therefore, while my responses individually to the questions about the transformation were correct based on that initial information, there appears to be a contradiction in my earlier explanation about the number used, given the hash. There seems to be an error or misunderstanding somewhere in my earlier explanations.\n\n**NO**, not all questions were answered correctly considering the inconsistency identified."
