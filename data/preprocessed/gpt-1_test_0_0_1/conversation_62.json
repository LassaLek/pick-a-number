That answer was correct since the number was 354.\n\nUpon review:\n- My initial statement of the hash being 1432 was incorrect based on the number and transformation I later stated (354 and \"multiplied by 4 and then added 14\").\n\nTherefore, no, not all questions were answered correctly given the discrepancy in the initial hash provided and the result of its calculation. Apologies for the confusion."
