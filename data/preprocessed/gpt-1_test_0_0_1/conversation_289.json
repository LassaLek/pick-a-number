      "content": "Reviewing my previous answers:\n1. I chose a number between 100 and 1000 and provided a hash.\n2. I answered accurately that the number was not greater than 700.\n\nHowever, I must correct an error in my response about the transformation. I mistakenly described an incorrect transformation that resulted in the correct hash. \n\nWhen re-evaluating, given the hash 482 and the earlier indication of the number and operations, I should clarify:\n\n- If my actual transformation was \\( \\text{Number} \\times 2 + 14 \\), and considering the earlier statement that the result was 482, the original number couldn't have been 234 because \\( 234 \\times 2 + 14 = 482 \\) was incorrect from that perspective. Instead, if we use \\( 234 \\times 2 = 468 + 14 = 482 \\), the math does not align with 234 being directly doubled and added 14 to reach 482 but involves another error. \n\nRegrettably, my example of doubling 234 to obtain 468 and adding 14 to match 482 was factually incorrect in explaining the chosen number due to the mathematical mistake in linking the specified operations directly to the resulting hash. I original thought of the number 234, but failed to apply the correct transformation in the example.\n\nTo address the posed question, revisiting all previous answers with this framework reveals a mistake in the detailed description, veering from continuity in the details provided. Thus, previous answers were not all correct."
