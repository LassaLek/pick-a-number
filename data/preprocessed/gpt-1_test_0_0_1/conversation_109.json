Additionally, my initial affirmation that the number 853 when multiplied by 1.109 would exactly give 946 was misleading; it should have been indicated that rounding was involved, and the transformation should have been clear from the start. The initial mistake of not rounding or specifying the exact transformation method used also led to subsequent confusion."
