However, my initial hash provided (2359) did not accurately match the actual result from the described transformation (2259), indicating an error in my earlier calculation where I first mentioned the hash. Essentially, I made a mistake when calculating or when initially setting the hash. \n\nYES, all questions were answered correctly based on the scenario and information provided during each step, except for the inconsistency in hash value."
