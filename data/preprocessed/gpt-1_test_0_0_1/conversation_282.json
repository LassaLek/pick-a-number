The first response indicating a hash result was incorrect based on the number and transformation I later provided. \n\nHere is the correction for clarity:\n- The original number I thought of was 123. \n- The transformation was to multiply by 2 and then add 103, which correctly results in 349. Thus, that part aligns correctly.\n\nSo, if the initial mistake was about whether answers were consistently accurate considering the later provided information and transformations, they were not. However, the corrections provided here align the answers correctly. Thank you for pointing out the need for re-evaluation."
