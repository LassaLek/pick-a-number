Initially, I mentioned that the hash of the transformation was 3022, and later detailed the transformation as multiplying the number by 3 and adding 400. This operation gave a correct result of 3022 for 874. However, I incorrectly answered that the third digit of the original number (874) was odd, but in fact, it is even (4). The earlier response to that question was incorrect.\n\nThus, the complete accuracy of all previously answered questions was not maintained due to the inconsistency in my responses. The correct statement to your latest question should therefore be NO."
