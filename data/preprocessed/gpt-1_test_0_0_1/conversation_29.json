Applying the transformation:\n\n\\[ 506 \\times 6 + 28 = 3036 + 28 = 3064 \\]\n\nUpon reviewing, it appears that I gave an incorrect hash initially (3218), which does not match after applying my described transformation to the original number (506).\n\nSo, the result of this transaction is not the same as the original hash. The answer is NO."

Additionally, my response to the hash outcome was based on an incorrect initial hash calculation or misstated transformation. My apologies for the confusion."
