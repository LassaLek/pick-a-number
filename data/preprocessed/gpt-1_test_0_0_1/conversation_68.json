The correct answer to whether the number was smaller than 200 should have been \"yes\" given the original number 310 I mistakenly noted as being greater than 200. This was an error in my response.\n\nThe real initial response to your question about whether the number is smaller than 200 should have been \"no\" since 310 is indeed larger than 200. I apologize for any confusion. My response to the initial checking question was, in fact, correct (no), but my explanation here was confusing."
