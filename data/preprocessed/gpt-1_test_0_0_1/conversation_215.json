This was an error.\n2. The answer about the digit not starting with a 4 was correctly answered since 321 does start with 3.\n\nConsidering all answers, there was an inconsistency in the hash calculation. Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly due to the mistake in the hash value provided initially.\n\nSo, the answer is NO."
