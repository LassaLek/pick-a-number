YES."

This all matches the data and operations I provided.\n\nRegarding your specific question about the evenness of the second digit of the number 253: the second digit is 5, which is indeed odd, and my initial response to that question was correct.\n\nGiven the analysis, I can confirm that all questions were answered correctly."
