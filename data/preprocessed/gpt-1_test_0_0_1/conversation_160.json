Therefore, the answers relating to the hash and the resulting number were not correct.\n\nIf we consider all the questions asked:\n- Asking if the number starts with 4, the answer was correctly stated as \"No\" since **456** does not start with 4. \n- However, the inconsistency with the hash values implies an error was made in the responses about the transformation and results.\n\nSo, were all of those questions answered correctly? **NO**."
