YES."

The correct transformation hash I initially stated was 275, but the calculated hash from the given number and transformation should have been 275, not 295 as accidentally mentioned in relation to whether the number starts with a 7. The responses to the questions about the digit the number starts with and revealing the number and transformation were handled correctly, but the mistake occurred in the initial hash description.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I apologize for any confusion."
