However, the direct answers to your specific questions about the properties of the number (whether the first digit is even) were answered correctly.\n\nSo, were all questions answered correctly concerning the properties of the number? **YES** (for the properties directly asked about). However, the handling of the hash and transformation was initially incorrect."
