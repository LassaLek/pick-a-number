Initially, I stated the resulting hash as **1542** from a number between 100 and 1000. Later, when discussing the actual transformation applied to the number 356 (which when multiplied by 3 and added to 474 indeed yields 1542), there was confusion since the response to your question about whether the number was larger than 600 should not have influenced that calculation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- **Original number (356) with transformation (356 * 3 + 474 = 1542)** was calculated correctly.\n- **The error lay in the logic of question management regarding the size of the number relative to 600, not affecting the mathematical transformation or its result but affecting consistency in the context of your questioning.**\n\nNO, not all questions were answered correctly based on the number and transformation criteria."
