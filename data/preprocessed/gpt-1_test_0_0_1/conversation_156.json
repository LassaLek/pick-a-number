The hash result I initially provided (**1458**) was incorrect based on the number (**362**) and the transformation (multiplication by 4) I later disclosed. This resulted in a discrepancy since the accurate result of the transformation should have been **1448**, not **1458** as initially stated. Therefore, my previous responses contained an error."
