Initially, I confirmed that the first digit of the number was odd, which is incorrect since the number I later declared was 384, and the first digit here ('3') is odd but does not match with my prior implication it being a single-digit figure.\n\nTherefore, not all questions were answered correctly based on the full context. Apologies for the confusion.\n\nTo correct it: NO, not all previous questions were answered correctly based on the full context."
