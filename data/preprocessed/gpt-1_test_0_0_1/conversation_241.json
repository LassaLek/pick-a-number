Reviewing the conversation and the original conditions set (number between 100 and 1000, smaller than 800), the number and transformation were not consistent with the hashed result I previously stated. The hash of 1936 does not align with a number smaller than 800 transformed as described. My apologies for any confusion caused by the inconsistency in the data provided."
