You asked if the number was smaller than 400, to which I correctly answered \"Yes\" because 314 is indeed smaller than 400.\n3. I then correctly recalled both the number and the transformation and verified the transformation led back to the initial hash I provided.\n\nTherefore, when considering all the previously asked questions and my responses, including the details of the calculation and the relationship between the original number and the hash, the answer to your query is:\n\n**YES**, all questions were answered correctly."
