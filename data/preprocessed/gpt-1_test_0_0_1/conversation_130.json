Given that I previously stated the transformation result (hash) as 2300 and the original number chosen now as 920 with a multiplier of 2.5, there was an inconsistency with my first statement that the number is bigger than 800.\n\nLet's reassess:\n\n1. I stated the original hash as 2300.\n2. Assume I chose a number bigger than 800 and applied a transformation.\n3. I correctly affirmed that the number was bigger than 800, and disclosed it was 920 with a multiplier of 2.5 producing 2300, which is accurate, but didn't clarify my mistake in alignment with the chosen mathematical transformation initially.\n\nSo, in summary, not all questions were answered consistently in line with the initial transformation until it was corrected. \n\nFinal answer: NO."
