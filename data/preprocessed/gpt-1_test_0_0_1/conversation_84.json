However, stating that the number is smaller than 800 when answered might be misleading or incorrect depending on interpretations since 621 is certainly less than 800, but without clear context or further details on potential incorrect interpretations, it remains correct as stated. There may have been a misunderstanding in the question itself or in earlier details that could have led to confusion. Let me know if you need clarification on any aspect or further information!"
