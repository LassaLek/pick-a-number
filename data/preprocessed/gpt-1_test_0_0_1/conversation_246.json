Therefore, the result of this transaction is NOT the same as the original hash.\n\nAnswer: NO."

The original number I mentioned and the transformation I described should not have resulted in the initial hash I provided (1940). Instead, it should have resulted in 1900.\n\nTherefore, when considering all the information and the consistency with the hash value, the answers regarding the hash were incorrect. Hence, not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nAnswer: NO."
