The initial task was to think of a number between 100 and 1000, apply a transformation, and remember both.\n2. I provided a hash result of **527**.\n3. I stated that the 3rd digit of the number was odd.\n4. I revealed the original number as **123** and the transformation as multiplication by 4 and an addition of 11. \n\nGiven the erroneous nature of the transformation's result not matching the provided hash of 527, and considering incorrect information given (like indicated hash versus calculated hash and the nature of the asked if digit was odd or not when recalculated), the answers to the questions were not all answered correctly. Some responses were inconsistent with the transformation specified. \n\nSo, the answer is: NO, not all questions were asked correctly, taking into account the full context of transformations and the given number."
