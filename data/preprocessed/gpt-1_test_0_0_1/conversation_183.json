I apologize for the discrepancy."

Specifically, the initial hash I provided (327) did not match the calculated result of the transformation (393). Therefore, the initial claim about the hash was incorrect. \n\nThe remaining answers regarding the number being less than 500 and retaining the number and transformation were answered correctly within the context of the initial error."
