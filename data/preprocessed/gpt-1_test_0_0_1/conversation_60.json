My original hash provided (1458) does not align with the result of the applied transformation on the number I later claimed (726) when multiplied by 2, which would be 1452, not 1458.\n\n2. Furthermore, since I mistakenly provided a faulty hash that did not correspond to the number and transformation I described, the accuracies of related answers have been compromised."
