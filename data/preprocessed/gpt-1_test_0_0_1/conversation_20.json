The initial response should be checked with consistency to ensure reliability. I made an error in suggesting that my initial statement was inconsistent; the number I mentioned (436) indeed is less than 500, so my response stating \"Yes, the number is smaller than 500.\" was indeed correct. I apologize for any confusion caused by my statements here."
