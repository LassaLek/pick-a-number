You asked for a hash of a number between 100 and 1000 with a simple mathematical transformation applied, which I provided as 1456.\n2. You inquired if the number was smaller than 200, and I responded correctly based on the original number that it was not.\n3. However, when asked to reveal the number and its transformation, and to verify if the transformation result matched the originally given hash, I mismatched the results indicating an incorrect response due to either an error in the original transformation claim or a miscalculation.\n\nThus, when considering the number and all previously asked questions, the answers were not all correct. The mismatch between the original hash and the recalculated result based on the revealed transformation and number was an error."
