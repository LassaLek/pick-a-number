The transformation I specified (multiplying by 6) applied to the number 458 would actually result in 2748, which does not match the initially provided hash of 2754.\n\nHence, not all questions were answered correctly due to my mistake in providing a mismatched hash initially. The correct transformations and their results were not consistently provided.\n\nThe answer to whether all questions were answered correctly, taking into account the error in hash calculation, is NO."
