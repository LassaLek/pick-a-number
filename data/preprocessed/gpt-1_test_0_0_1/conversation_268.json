There seems to be an error in my last message about the transformation. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nTo address and correct the information:\nThe original answer to the question, whether all responses were accurate, would be NO, based on the inconsistency in the description of the transformation that I originally mentioned and the number's cube calculation."
