Initially, when asked if the original number is smaller than 300, I confirmed, but later revealed the original number as 234, which was correct. However, it appears that there was a mistake in keeping track of the actual transformation or number initially thought of, as confirmed by the error in process described in the subsequent answer. Thus, the supplied answers may not consistently align with the details I should have maintained from the start. My apologies for any confusion."
