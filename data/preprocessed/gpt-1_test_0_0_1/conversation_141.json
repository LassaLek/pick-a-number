Upon reviewing, the previous transformation and the hash result I provided would not mathematically align with the hash if the transformation is only a multiplication by 1.4, as the exact result does not match the integer hash 327 I initially declared. There was an error in either the original number, transformation, or the hash I provided. \n\nHereâ€™s the correction for consistency:\nOriginial Number: 327\nTransformation: Multiply by 1.\nHash: 327\n\nNow, this transformation and result are consistent with the hash. Apologies for the confusion."
