I initially claimed the hash from the transformation of the number between 100 and 1000 was 585, but the original number I thought of was 195 and the transformation I described (multiplying by 3) would indeed produce 585. However, I incorrectly stated the number was 195 in my response to the follow-up question; the number could be anything between 100 and 1000, and I did not explicitly state this again until now."
