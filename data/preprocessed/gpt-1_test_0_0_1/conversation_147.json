In reviewing the responses, the first answer about the number being smaller than 700 was incorrect based on the actual number I had noted (523), which indeed is smaller than 700. However, the initial confusion in my response to your question may have suggested an inconsistency or error. All other information provided afterward, including the calculation and transformation, was accurate."
