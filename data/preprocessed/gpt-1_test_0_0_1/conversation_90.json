Since the initial hash should have been correctly calculated from the transformation I described, but an error occurred in my calculation or reporting, not all questions were answered correctly based on consistent information.\n\nThus, the answer to your question is NO, all the previous questions were not answered correctly considering the error I made with the initial hash calculation that I reported."
