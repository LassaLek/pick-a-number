The computed hash was stated as 1329, but when questioned about the number being less than 900, my response was affirmative, which hinted at the number itself (369). While the reveal and calculation later aligned correctly, the initial withheld details could have led to confusion or an indirect disclosure of sorts when piecing together the responses.\n\nSo, the answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is NO due to potential indirect hints given in my previous answers."
