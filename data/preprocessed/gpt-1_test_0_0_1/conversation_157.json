Where things went wrong: The hash I initially provided (3215) did not match the output of the transformation when recalculated with the number and transformation I later disclosed (2975).\n\nSo, to answer your question: NO, not all questions were answered correctly, considering the hash inconsistency highlighted by the final inquiry."
