However, since the transformation was slightly incorrect in accurately explaining the exact output (since 742.66 rounds to 743 due to decimal handling and should be stated explicitly), that part of the explanation might cause confusion.\n\nThe answer should have explicitly involved rounding or possibly used a different operation to avoid decimals for more precise and clear communication.\n\nI apologize for any confusion."
