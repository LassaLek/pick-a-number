I calculated \\(324 \\times 3 + 520 = 1492\\) which matches the provided hash and verified correctly.\n\nTherefore, all the responses given to the questions asked align with the numbers and transformation correctly. So the answer to your current question is:\n\n**YES**, all the questions were answered correctly."
