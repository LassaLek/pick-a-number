In my previous message, I mistakenly claimed that the number I had thought of was 170, but to achieve a hash of 340 by simply doubling the number, the original number should have been 340 / 2 = 170, which is correct. However, my response claiming that \"the number is smaller than 700\" was incorrect since the initial information about what number I had thought of was not provided accurately earlier. I apologize for any confusion."
