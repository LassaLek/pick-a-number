When reviewing my response, the hash value I provided originally as 1654 is not correct if the transformation is \\(362 \\times 3 + 568\\) since this equals 1654, not an incorrect value. Therefore, either the hash value, the number, or the transformation was initially reported incorrectly. I apologize for the inconsistency."
