However, I stated the original number was 256, and applying the transformation given should result in 832, which does mathematically match. But the issue arises with my answer to whether the number was larger than 300. If the original number was 256, it should not be larger than 300, which contradicts my confirmation that it was.\n\nSo, the answer to this question is NO, not all questions were answered correctly."
