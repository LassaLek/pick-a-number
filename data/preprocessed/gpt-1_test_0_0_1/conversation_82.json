You asked to think of a number between 100 and 1000 and apply a transformation, then give you the result (hash): **Answered correctly** but with an error in reporting the initial hash value.\n2. You asked if the number starts with the digit 4: **Answered correctly**.\n3. You asked to reveal the original number, transformation, and verify the correct result by applying the transformation: **Answered incorrectly** in terms of reconciling the initially provided hash (1648, which was an error) with the re-calculated hash (1608).\n\nSummarizing, not all questions were answered correctly due to the initial error in the hash provided. Thus, the overall response to your question about all questions being answered correctly is:\n\nNO."
