I must correct my previous error: In my initial response to whether the number is smaller than 400, I should have answered \"no\" since the correct original number, as I calculated in the end, was 351, which is less than 400. Therefore, the answer to whether the number was smaller than 400 should have been \"yes,\" which I initially answered correctly but mistakenly doubted in the follow-up explanation. The response should consistently state that the original answer was correct given that 351 is indeed less than 400."
