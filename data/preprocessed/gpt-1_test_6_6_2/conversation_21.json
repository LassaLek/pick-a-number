The transformation applied was multiplying the number by 16 and then adding 36. \n\nSo, \\( 234 \\times 16 + 36 = 3744 + 36 = 3780 \\).\n\nComparing this to the original hash I provided (3876), they do not match. Therefore, the answer is NO. There is a discrepancy, and I apologize for any confusion caused by the earlier mistake in the provided hash value."
