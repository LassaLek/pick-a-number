Is the number smaller than 900? - Correctly answered as \"No.\"\n5. Is the 2-nd digit of the number odd? - Incorrectly answered; confusion in the response, could be interpreted as \"No.\" \n6. Does the number start with a digit 2? - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n7. Is the number smaller than 600? - Correctly answered as \"No.\"\n8. Is the number smaller than 100? - Correctly answered as \"No.\"\n9. Is the number bigger than 100? - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n\nThe previous response to question 5 about the second digit was misleading or incorrect, as I incorrectly stated that the digit was odd after mistakenly providing additional information about the evenness of the digit 2 instead of correctly just confirming the response.\n\nHence, not all questions were answered correctly. The correct answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is NO."
