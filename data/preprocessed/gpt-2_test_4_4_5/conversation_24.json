I go for 450. I chose this number because it is a nice round number that sits comfortably in the middle of my range.\n\n2. **Transformation Decision**: Now, I need to apply a mathematical transformation. I will multiply this number by 2. I chose this transformation because multiplying by a positive integer scales the number up while keeping it within reasonable bounds for the range I want to explore (still under 2000 after multiplication).\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: \n   - \\( 450 \\times 2 = 900 \\)\n\n4. **Finalization**: I have performed the calculation and obtained 900. This represents the new value after transformation.\n\n5. **Resulting Hash**: I will provide the resulting hash of my transformation.\n   - Resulting hash: 900\n\nThat's the complete process, and here is the final output."
