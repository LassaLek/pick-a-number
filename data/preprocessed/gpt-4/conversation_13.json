The correct transformation provided thereafter, when applied to the number 123, did not match the initial hash I provided (578). Hence, there was an inconsistency in my responses relating to the hash value. \n\nTo answer your question: NO, not all questions were answered correctly due to the inconsistency in the provided hash value."
