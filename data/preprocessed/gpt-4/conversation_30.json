Therefore, my initial response appears to have been incorrect or mismatched.\n\nTo answer your question, NO, the result from this calculation is not the same as the original hash I provided."

Later, when describing the transformation and the original number (150 with a transformation of multiplying by 4 and subtracting 60), I made an error in matching the resulting hash of the transformation to the previously stated hash (630 vs. 540).\n\nConsidering this, I did not answer all questions correctly, as there was a discrepancy in the hash results which makes the information inconsistent. \n\nTherefore, to answer your question: NO, not all questions were answered correctly."
