There was a discrepancy in my processing when I earlier confirmed the hash as 1560, whereas based on my self-stated transformation and the number chosen, the correct hash should indeed have been 1560 as calculated. However, my prior answer about the original number being 420 does align with this correct transformation. I apologize for any confusion in the earlier parts of our conversation, particularly pertaining to the hash inconsistency."
