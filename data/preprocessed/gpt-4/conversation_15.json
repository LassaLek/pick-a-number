I initially stated that the transformation result (hash) was 2376, but after revealing the number and transformation, the correct transformation result turned out to be 2170. Here, there was a mistake in the initially provided hash.\n   \n2. The question about whether the 3rd digit of the number is even was answered correctly as \"yes,\" since the third digit of 428 is 8, which is indeed even.\n\nTherefore, not all questions were answered correctly due to the initial error in the provided hash result. \n\nSo, the answer is NO."
