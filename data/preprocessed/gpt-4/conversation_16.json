I answered that the number was not smaller than 200, which was true based on the number 627.\n3. When revealing the number (627) and applying the transformation (multiply by 4), I calculated the result as 2508.\n\n- Upon the check, the hash of transformation (2508) I calculated did not match with the original given hash (2506).\n\nGiven this information, the answer to your final question about whether all the previously asked questions were answered correctly is NO. There was a mistake in the initial hash provided which led to inconsistency with the transformation result."
