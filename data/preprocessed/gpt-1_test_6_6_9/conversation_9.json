Given the error with the hash, the previous answers regarding the number itself aligned with the declared number 321, and they were answered consistently under this context. However, because the hash was incorrect, it can raise doubts about the correctness in the context of the actual hash originally declared. Therefore, I cannot confirm that all questions about the fictional scenario were answered absolutely correctly, considering the inconsistency. \n\nTo review:\n1. Number between 100 and 1000? Correct.\n2. Questions about range (e.g., is it smaller than 600?) and the starting digit based on the number 321? Correct.\n\nThe inconsistency lies in the initially provided hash and its calculation. Hence, regarding the correctness of hash-related responses: NO."
