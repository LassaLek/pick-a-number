Let's pick an arbitrary number starting with 3, below 400, with the first digit odd: for this, we'll use 315.\n2. If I previously indicated a hash result of 4524, a simple transformation I could have used could be multiplying the number by some factor and adding a constant. \n\nFor instance:\n\nIf the number I thought of was 315, and we used the transformation number x 14 + 4 = hash:\n\\[ 315 \\times 14 + 4 = 4414 + 4 = 4418 \\]\n\nThis does not match the hash I originally gave (4524). Therefore, there's been a misunderstanding or error in conveying the transformation consistent with the hash originally stated in our fictional scenario.\n\nDoes the recalculated hash from the transformation I just provided match the original hash stated (4524)? NO."
