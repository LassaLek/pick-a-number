Does the number start with a digit 4? - Answer: No (Correct for number 145)\n5. Is the number bigger than 600? - Answer: No (Correct for number 145)\n6. Is the 3-rd digit of the number odd? - Answer: Yes (This was incorrect for number 145 since the third digit, 5 is odd, but it contradicts because the number never has digit 600)\n\nAll questions except the 6th one were grounded on incorrect tracking. \n\nFinal answer based on the review: NO."
