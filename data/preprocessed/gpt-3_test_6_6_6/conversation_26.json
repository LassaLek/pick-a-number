Is the third digit of the number odd? Answer: I initially said it was even. So, \"No\" here would have been correct.\n5. Is the number bigger than 300? Answer: No (Mistakenly answered Yes).\n6. Does the number start with a digit 8? Answer: No (Correct, as 200 starts with 2).\n\nNot every question was answered correctly due to a mistake on question 5. \n\nNO"
