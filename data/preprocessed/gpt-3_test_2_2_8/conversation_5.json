Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the number 256.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation:**\n   - I'll decide on a simple transformation. Let's apply multiplication by a constant. I'll multiply the number by 5.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - Multiply the chosen number (256) by 5.\n   - Calculation: 256 * 5 = 1280.\n\n4. **Confirming the Transformed Value:**\n   - The result of multiplying 256 by 5 is indeed 1280. This is the transformed value, checked and confirmed.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1280"
