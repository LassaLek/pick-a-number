Let's clarify:\n\n- The transformation provided was to multiply by 3 and add 7.\n- Applying this transformation to the original number, which should have been established as 831: (831 * 3) + 7 = 2500.\n\nHowever, it seems there was confusion in the numerical details initially shared. The outcome is not as expected based on the constraint that the number should be below 200.\n\nTo answer whether the resulted hash from the correct number is the same as the initially given hash: NO.\n\nI apologize for the oversight. Please let me know how you would like to proceed."
