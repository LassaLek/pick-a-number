Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This will allow me to easily calculate and understand the result.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: So the transformation would be:\n   \\[\n   250 + 75 = 325\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the resulting transformed value**: The calculation yields 325. I’ll double-check the arithmetic:\n   \\[\n   250 + 75 = 325\n   \\]\n   The result is indeed correct.\n\nNow, based on the calculations and confirmations, the final transformed value (hash) can be provided. \n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 325"
