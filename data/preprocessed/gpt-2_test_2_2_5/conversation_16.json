Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I'll pick 350 as my number, which is comfortably within that range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I want to apply a simple mathematical transformation. Let's go with multiplying my chosen number by 3. This will yield a larger number while keeping the operation straightforward.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: I'll perform the multiplication now:\n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: I will double-check my calculation to ensure accuracy:\n   - \\( 350 \\times 3 = 1050 \\) indeed holds true as I can break this down if needed (which would be \\( 350 + 350 + 350 \\)).\n   \n5. **Final Output**: Since all steps check out and the transformed value has been confirmed, I will now declare the final result.\n\nThe final transformed value (hash) is: **1050**."
