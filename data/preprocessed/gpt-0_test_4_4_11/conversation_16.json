Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.
