I chose this number because it is a nice round number that is exactly in the middle of my range, making subsequent calculations straightforward.\n\nStep 2: **Choosing a Mathematical Transformation**\nFor my transformation, I will multiply the number by 2. I chose multiplication by 2 because it is a simple operation that will significantly increase the value of the number while still allowing me to keep it manageable for calculation and understanding.\n\nStep 3: **Calculating the Result**\nNow, I will carry out this multiplication:\n\\[ \n450 \\times 2 = 900 \n\\]\n\nStep 4: **Result**\nFinally, the resulting hash, which is the output after performing the calculation, is:\n**Resulting hash: 900**"
