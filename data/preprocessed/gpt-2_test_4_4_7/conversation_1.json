Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I chosen this number because it’s centrally located within the range, making calculations more illustrative and balanced.\n\n2. Now, I will perform a mathematical transformation. I choose to multiply the number by 2. This transformation was chosen because multiplication by a whole number will help me to see how much larger the number can get and it allows for a clearer demonstration of scaling a number.\n\n3. I will calculate the result of the transformation:\n   \\[\n   425 \\times 2 = 850\n   \\]\n\n4. I’ll now create a simple hash from this result. In this case, I will just present the resulting number as the hash itself.\n\n5. Resulting hash: 850 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)"
