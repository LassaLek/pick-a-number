The number was guessed correctly as 345 (starts with 5, smaller than 500, 2nd digit is odd, smaller than 400, 1st digit is odd).\n2. The transformation was correctly identified as multiplying by 3.\n3. The result of the transformation matched the original hash provided.\n\nSo, all the questions were answered correctly."
