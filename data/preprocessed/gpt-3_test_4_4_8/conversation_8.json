      "content": "Step 1: Choosing a Number\n- I need to select a number between 100 and 1000. \n- Deciding on a number is a random process; however, aiming for simplicity, let’s choose a round number, say 250. This selection makes it easier to perform transformations due to its simplicity.\n\nStep 2: Choosing a Transformation\n- The task requires applying a simple mathematical transformation. I could multiply, divide, add, or subtract a value from the chosen number. \n- For simplicity and to significantly shift the value, let’s choose multiplication.\n- I will multiply the chosen number (250) by 3. This operation scales the number, increasing its magnitude—a straightforward way to observe a clear transformation.\n\nStep 3: Performing the Transformation\n- Using the multiplication operation: \n  \\[\n  250 \\times 3 = 750\n  \\]\n- The multiplication by 3 is chosen because it creates a clear change while keeping the final value within the boundaries of typical number scaling techniques—simple and effective.\n\nStep 4: Resulting Hash\n- After performing the calculation, the resulting hash is 750. \n\nTherefore, the resulting hash after the transformation is 750."

Since you mentioned a mathematical transformation, remember that the resulting hash (750) doesn't directly reflect the bounds of the original number without understanding the transformation applied. However, as per your question, 250 is indeed larger than 200."
