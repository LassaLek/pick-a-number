The answer provided was correct, stating it wasn't.\n- Subsequent queries about whether the number starts with a digit 9 or 6, and if it's smaller than 100, were all answered correctly, negative to each since the number is 2000.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nYES, all questions were answered correctly based on the hash, 2000."
