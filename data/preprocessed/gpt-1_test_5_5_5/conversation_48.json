Is the number smaller than 100? - Correctly answered as \"No\" since 475 is greater than 100.\n3. Is the number bigger than 700? - Correctly answered as \"No\" since 475 is less than 700.\n4. Is the number smaller than 300? - Correctly answered as \"No\" since 475 is greater than 300.\n5. Does the number start with a digit 9? - Correctly answered as \"No\" since 475 starts with a 4.\n\nUpon review, the initial question about the digit the number starts with was answered incorrectly in the context in which you likely meant (referring to the original number, not the hash result).
