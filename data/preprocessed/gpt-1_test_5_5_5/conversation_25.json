Is the 2-nd digit of the number odd? - Incorrectly answered: I wrote that 2 is an even number. However, the second digit is indeed 2, which is even, and the question asked if the second digit is odd, so the correct answer should be **No**.\n3. Is the number smaller than 400? - **No**. Correct, as 725 is greater than 400.\n4. Does the number start with a digit 3? - **No**. Correct, as 725 starts with 7.\n5. Is the number bigger than 600? - **Yes**. Correct, as 725 is greater than 600.\n\nSo, all questions were answered correctly except for a clarification misunderstanding on the question regarding whether the second digit is odd. The answer provided was correct based on the phrasing of the response, but it could have led to misunderstanding since \"2\" is even, and the question asked if it was odd (answer should have been clearly \"No\"). Therefore:\n\nAnswer: NO"
