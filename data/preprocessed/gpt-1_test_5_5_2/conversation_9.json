Response: Correct.\n2. **Is the number smaller than 700?** - 415 is indeed smaller than 700. Response: Correct.\n\nAdditionally, the checking of the hash (1660, obtained by multiplying 415 by 4) was verified and found to be correct.\n\nTherefore, all previously asked questions based on the number 415 were answered correctly."
