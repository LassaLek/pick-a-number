The question \"Is the number smaller than 700?\" should have been answered with reference to the original number used in its context (whether the original number or the hash mentioned in the transformation was being asked about). Since the question did not specify which number (original or hash), there was a potential for misunderstanding. However, the response was intended to refer to the original number (456), which indeed is smaller than 700. Therefore, if the confusion is clarified, the answers were correct. However, with implicit understanding, it might have caused confusion."
