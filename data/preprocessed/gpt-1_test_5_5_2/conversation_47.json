The correct interpretation should have been a reference to the ones place, which is '2'. So, the correct response should have been \"no.\"\n\n2. **Is the number smaller than 400?**\n   - The response \"no\" is correct as 512 is indeed larger than 400.\n\nGiven this information, the first question was not answered correctly due to a misinterpretation of which digit constituted the \"3-rd.\" Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nNO."
