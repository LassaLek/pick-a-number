I inaccurately stated that the first digit, which is 4, is even, not odd. This is a correct statement about the digit being even, but it does not respond correctly to your question about the digit being odd. Thus, the correct response to your question should be \"no.\"\n\nBased on this review, not all questions were answered correctly."
