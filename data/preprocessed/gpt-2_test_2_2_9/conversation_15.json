Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will choose the number 250. \n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. For this example, I will choose to multiply the number by 4. This choice is straightforward and will significantly change the number while still remaining within a manageable range.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:\n- The initial number is 250.\n- I will multiply it by 4: \n  \\[\n  250 \\times 4 = 1000\n  \\]\n\nNext, I confirm the resulting transformed value:\n- The result from the multiplication is 1000.\n\nNow that I have completed all the steps in my reasoning, the final result (hash) value is 1000."
