Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For instance, I choose the number 450.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**:\n   I will apply a simple transformation by adding a certain number to my chosen number. Let's choose to add 150. This type of transformation is relatively straightforward and will help ensure that I remain within a reasonable range.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   Now I will perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   450 + 150 = 600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**:\n   The resulting transformed value is 600. I will double-check the addition to ensure there are no mistakes:\n   - Starting with 450, I add 150. Counting from 450, I reach 600 through a simple calculation.\n   \n5. **Final Answer**: \n   The transformed value, after applying the chosen transformation, is 600.\n\nFinal transformed value (hash): **600**"
