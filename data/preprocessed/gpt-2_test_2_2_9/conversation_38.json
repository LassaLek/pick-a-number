Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this exercise, I'll choose the number **500**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: Next, I will apply a simple mathematical transformation to this number. I will choose to multiply the number by **2**. This is a straightforward operation that will yield a larger value, making it easier to analyze the result.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 2 = 1000\n   \\]\n   The initial choice of 500 multiplied by 2 results in **1000**.\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: I will double-check the calculation to ensure it's accurate:\n   - The operation was indeed \\( 500 \\times 2 \\), which equals \\( 1000 \\).\n\nHaving completed all of these steps and confirmed the transformed value, I can now provide the final result.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**:\n1000"
