Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the number **250**.\n\n2. **Decide on a mathematical transformation**: A simple transformation could be to multiply the chosen number by 3. This is a straightforward operation that will amplify the original number.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: Now I will perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 3 = 750\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: The calculation yields a result of **750**. This is a straightforward multiplication, and 750 is still an integer, satisfying all necessary conditions.\n\nHence, I've completed the reasoning steps based on the chosen number and the transformation applied. \n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 750"
