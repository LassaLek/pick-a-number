      "content": "You are about to choose a number and apply a mathematical transformation. Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will select the number 450.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. For this example, I will opt to multiply the chosen number by 2 and then add 50 to the product. This combination of multiplication and addition will result in a new number that is relatively straightforward to calculate.\n\nNow, I will perform the transformation step-by-step:\n1. Take the chosen number: 450.\n2. Multiply it by 2: \n   \\[\n   450 \\times 2 = 900.\n   \\]\n3. Add 50 to the result:\n   \\[\n   900 + 50 = 950.\n   \\]\n\nThe resulting transformed value is 950. \n\nNow, I will present the final answer based on the transformation performed.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 950"
