Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I choose 250.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: Next, I will decide on a simple mathematical transformation. I will opt to multiply the chosen number (250) by 4. This transformation is simple and will give me a clear output.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I'll perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Transformed Value**: I check my calculation:\n   - \\(250 \\times 4\\) indeed equals \\(1000\\).\n\nNow, I've completed my steps and my final transformed value (hash) is:\n\n1000"
