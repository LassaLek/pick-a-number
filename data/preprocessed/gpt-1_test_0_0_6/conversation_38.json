Is the 2nd digit of the number odd?\n   - **Answer:** No.\n   - **Correct:** Yes, since the 2nd digit is 2, which is even.\n\n3. Is the number bigger than 800?\n   - **Answer:** No.\n   - **Correct:** Yes, since 524 is less than 800.\n\n4. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd?\n   - **Answer:** No.\n   - **Correct:** Yes, since the 3rd digit is 4, which is even.\n\n5. Is the number bigger than 700?\n   - **Answer:** No.\n   - **Correct:** Yes, since 524 is less than 700.\n\n6. Is the number bigger than 500?\n   - **Answer:** Yes.\n   - **Correct:** Yes, since 524 is greater than 500 but less than 700.\n\nAll responses to the questions were indeed correct based on the chosen number, 524.\n\n**YES**, all of those questions were answered correctly."
