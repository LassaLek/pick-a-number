(Correct)\n\n3. **Does the number start with a digit 2?**  \n   No, 763 does not start with 2. (Correct)\n\n4. **Does the number start with a digit 3?**  \n   No, 763 does not start with 3. (Correct)\n\n5. **Is the 3rd digit of the number odd?** (Asked again)  \n   Yes, the 3rd digit is still 3, and it is odd. (Correct)\n\n6. **Is the number bigger than 300?**  \n   Yes, 763 is bigger than 300.
