Is the number smaller than 500? - Answered correctly as Yes.\n3. Is the number smaller than 100? - Correctly noted that it could not be because the range is 100 to 1000.\n4. For both inquiries about whether the second digit is odd - Correctly answered as Yes, since the second digit is 5.\n\nThus, yes, all responses were accurate in the context of the number 258.\n\nYES."
