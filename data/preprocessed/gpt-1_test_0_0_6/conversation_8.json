However, when asked if the third digit is even, I also answered \"Yes,\" which was incorrect as the third digit of 426 is 6, which is indeed even. \n\nThus, based on the total responses related to 426, the questions were answered correctly. The inconsistency lies in the original hash provided compared to the result of the transformation.\n\n**YES** all question answers about the number's properties were correctly answered according to the number provided."
