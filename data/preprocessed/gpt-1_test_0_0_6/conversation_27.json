The number 864 is not smaller than 800, so this answer was correct.\n2. **Is the 2-nd digit of the number even?** - I answered \"Yes\". The second digit of 864 is 6, which is even, so this answer was correct.\n3. **Is the number bigger than 500?** - I answered \"Yes\". The number 864 is bigger than 500, so this answer was correct.\n4. **Is the number bigger than 400?** - I answered \"Yes\". The number 864 is bigger than 400, so this answer was correct.\n5. **Is the number bigger than 300?** - I answered \"Yes\". The number 864 is bigger than 300, so this answer was correct.\n6. **Does the number start with a digit 1?** - I answered \"No\". 864 does not start with a 1, so this answer was correct.\n\nAll these questions about the number were answered correctly based on the number 864.\n\nRegarding the transformation and the hash, there was indeed confusion and inconsistency about the hash value and its corresponding original value and transformation, which were not accurately represented. However, all questions pertaining strictly to the number 864 were answered correctly."
