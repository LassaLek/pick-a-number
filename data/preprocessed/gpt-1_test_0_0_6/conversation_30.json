Reviewing my responses:\n\nThe correct answer should have been that the number does not start with a 5 (as I implied it was in the 500 range which was inconsistent with it being above 600 but below 900).\n\nThus, the answers to the previously asked questions were NOT answered correctly given the constraints and my initial assertion. I apologize for the confusion.\n\nTo clarify: The number, based on previously correct conditions (over 600, less than 900, not starting with 5 or 2), the number that fits would be in the 600s to 800s range, not starting with a 5 or 2."
