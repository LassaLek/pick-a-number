Furthermore, the incorrect transformation result provided at first also adds to the mismatches. \n\nTherefore, not all questions were answered correctly in the context of the number and the transformation initially described.\n\nTo correct my earlier statements:\n\n- The number 813 is correctly identified as being bigger than 500 and smaller than 1000.\n- The initial claim that the number was not smaller than 700 was wrong (The number 813 is indeed smaller than 700).\n\nSo, to your question if all previous answers were correct: NO."
