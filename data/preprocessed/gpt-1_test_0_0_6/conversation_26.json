Rechecking consistency through the questions asked about which digit the number starts with, the responses provided have been inconsistent with the final revealed number of 521.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- The number 521 indeed does not start with a digit 1.\n- The number 521 is smaller than 600 but greater than 200.\n- However, upon review of questions related to specific starting digits, the number 521 starts with '5' and my response indicated that 521 starts with '5' but then I incorrectly addressed the digit 5 again which causes error.\n\nNO, the answers were not all correct depending on how we evaluate the questions about starting digits with respect to 521. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses."
