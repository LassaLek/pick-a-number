Given the number 228 lies precisely between 200 and 300, responses to queries about its relation to 200 and 300 should have been correct but there seems to have been an oversight in my affirmation to these constraints.\n\nReviewing the details:\n\n- The number was correctly identified as being greater than 200 and less than 300.\n- The number was, as stated, not greater than 400, which was correct.\n- Saying the number is not smaller than 200 was correct, as 228 is greater than 200.\n- However, when asked if the number is smaller than 300, I appropriately confirmed this.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the answers to questions, barring any misunderstandings in interpretation, appear to have been answered correctly.\n\nYES"
