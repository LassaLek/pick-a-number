However, the question about whether the second digit is odd was answered incorrectly because the second digit of 412 is **1**, which is indeed odd, so that answer was actually correct. \n\nTherefore, all questions based on the number 412 were answered correctly, given the constraints I provided in each response. My apologies for any confusion in the review."
