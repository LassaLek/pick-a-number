Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose a round, easy-to-remember number to facilitate calculations. I'll choose 500.\n\n2. **Deciding on a simple mathematical transformation:**\n   - To ensure the transformation is straightforward yet not trivial, I'll select multiplication, which produces significant change but is easy to calculate. Multiply by 3 is my chosen transformation because it's simple and will yield a result that remains within a manageable range for interpretation.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation:**\n   - Now I need to multiply 500 (the chosen number) by 3. The calculation is straightforward:\n     \\[ 500 \\times 3 = 1500 \\]\n   \n4. **Confirming the resulting transformed value:**\n   - The resulting value from applying the chosen transformation is 1500, which indeed satisfies the requirement of being a simple, easily computed transformation of the original number.\n\nThe final hash value, based on the instructions and calculations made, is 1500. This value straightforwardly reflects the chosen transformation applied to the selected initial number.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):"
