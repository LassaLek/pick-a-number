However, the follow-up question asking if the number (original, not hash) was bigger than 600 had an inaccurate response: the original number 456 is not bigger than 600, but the hash 1824 is. Thus, the initial response to whether the number was bigger than 600 incorrectly referred to the hash rather than the original number."
