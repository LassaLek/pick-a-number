Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

A simple choice would be the number 250, which lies comfortably within the given range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation:**\n   - A suitable simple mathematical transformation could be to add a number to my chosen integer. I'll decide to add 75 to the number.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - Starting with my original number, 250, I'll apply the transformation by adding 75:\n     \\[\n     250 + 75 = 325\n     \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result:**\n   - The resulting number after applying my transformation is 325. This result is obtained by the straightforward addition calculated above.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n325"
