Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I'll choose to add 75.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - Original Number: 250\n   - Transformation: Add 75\n   - Calculation: \\(250 + 75 = 325\\)\n\n4. **Confirming the Transformed Value**:\n   - The final result after transformation is indeed 325.\n\nFinal Answer (Transformed Value):\n325"
