Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's select **250**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation:** For a simple mathematical transformation, I will choose to multiply the number by **4**. This is a straightforward operation that will significantly change the number while remaining easy to compute.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation:** Now, I will multiply 250 by 4.\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the result:** I will check the multiplication.\n   - \\(250 \\times 4\\) indeed equals \\(1000\\). This confirms that the operation is accurate.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1000"
