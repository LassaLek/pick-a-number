Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, let's multiply the chosen number by 3 and then add 25 to the result. This transformation is simple yet effective.\n\nNow, I will calculate the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the chosen number: 512.\n2. Multiply by 3: \n   \\[\n   512 \\times 3 = 1536\n   \\]\n3. Now, add 25 to the result:\n   \\[\n   1536 + 25 = 1561\n   \\]\n\nI have confirmed that the resulting transformed value is 1561.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 1561"
