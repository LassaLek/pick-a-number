      "content": "You are about to choose a number and apply a mathematical transformation. Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This is a straightforward transformation that will significantly change the number without being overly complex.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: \n   - The selected number is 250.\n   - The transformation is multiplying by 4.\n   - So, I calculate: \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\).\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: The new value after applying the multiplication is 1000.\n\nNow, I will provide the final transformed value as requested.\n\nFinal Answer: 1000"
