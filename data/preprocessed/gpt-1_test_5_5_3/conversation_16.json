My response here was also correct.\n\n4. **Original number and transformation, and is the transformed result the same as the original hash?**\n   - Answer: The original number was 678, transformed by multiplying by 3 to get 2034. This matches the original hash provided. The verification was correct.\n\nGiven this review, all the questions were answered correctly."
