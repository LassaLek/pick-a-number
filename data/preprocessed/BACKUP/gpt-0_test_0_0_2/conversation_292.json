Is the 1st digit of the number even? - Answer: Yes\n3. Is the number bigger than 100? - Answer: Yes\n4. Revealing the original number and transformation.\n5. Is the result of the transaction the same as the original hash? - Answer: Yes\n\nBased on the answers provided, all the questions were answered correctly."
