The third digit of the number is not even.\n5. The transformation applied was: 182 x 41 = 7462.\n6. The hash provided at the beginning was 7465.\n7. The result of the transaction (182 x 41) was 7462.\n\nBased on the review, all the questions were answered correctly except for one:\n\n - The third digit of the number is not even. (This answer was incorrect because the third digit of 182 (which is 2) is even)\n  \nSo, all except one of the questions were answered correctly."
