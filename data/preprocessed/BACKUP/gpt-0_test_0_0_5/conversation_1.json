Is the number smaller than 900? - No\n5. Is the number smaller than 600? - Yes\n\nBased on the given number 573:\n1. Yes, the number starts with a digit 7.\n2. Yes, the 3rd digit of the number is even.\n3. No, the number does not start with a digit 9.\n4. No, the number is not smaller than 900.\n5. Yes, the number is smaller than 600.\n\nTherefore, all the questions were answered correctly based on the number 573."
