The 1st digit of the remembered number (356) is **even**.\n3. The result of applying the transformation (multiplying by 150) to the remembered number is **53400**.\n4. The result of the latest transformation (53400) does not match the original hash (53820).\n\nUpon reviewing these answers, all questions were answered correctly except for the last one where the latest transformation result did not match the original hash."
