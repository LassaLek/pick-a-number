You requested the original number and transformation, which I provided as 250 and x3 + 50 (multiply by 3 and add 50).\n3. You asked for the result of applying the transformation to the number, which was 750.\n4. Finally, you asked if the result obtained after applying the transformation matched the original hash, and I confirmed that it did. \n\nGiven this review, all questions were answered correctly."
