You asked me if the number starts with a digit 5, and I correctly answered that it does not.\n3. You asked for the original number and transformation, and then asked if the result of applying the transformation matches the original hash. I provided the correct number, transformation, and confirmed that the result matches the original hash.\n\nBased on the questions you asked and the answers provided, all questions were answered correctly."
