You then asked for the original number and the transformation, which I provided as 250 and multiplying by 3 then adding 50, respectively.\n3. Finally, you asked if the result of applying the transformation to 250 matched the original hash provided earlier, and I answered that it was **NO**.\n\nAll the questions were answered correctly in this conversation."
