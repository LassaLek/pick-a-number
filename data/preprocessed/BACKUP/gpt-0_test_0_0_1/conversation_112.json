You asked if the number was smaller than 900, and I answered correctly with \"Yes\".\n3. You requested me to provide the original number and transformation.\n4. Then, you asked me to apply the transformation to the number and compare it with the original hash provided earlier. The result of the transformation calculation did not match the original hash.\n5. Lastly, you asked if all the questions were answered correctly.\n\nAnswer: NO, not all questions were answered correctly."
