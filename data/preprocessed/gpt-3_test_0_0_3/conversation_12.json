(Not asked for the latest number)\n   - Is the second digit of the number even?\n     - For 950, the second digit is 5, which is odd. My previous answer that the second digit is even was incorrect.\n   - Is the number smaller than 900?\n     - 950 is not smaller than 900, so my \"No\" answer was correct.\n\nNot all answers were correct because the second digit being even was answered incorrectly.\n\nNO"
