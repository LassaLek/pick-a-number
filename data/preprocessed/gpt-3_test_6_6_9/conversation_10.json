Answer: No. (Correct)\n5. Does the number start with a digit 5? Answer: No. (Correct)\n6. Does the number start with a digit 4? Answer: No. (I mistakenly said this for a question that should not have been asked, given the previous context)\n7. Is the number bigger than 100? Answer: Yes. (Correct)\n8. Is the number bigger than 800? Answer: Yes.
