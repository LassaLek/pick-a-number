Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

For the mathematical transformation, I will multiply the number by 3.\n4. I chose multiplication by 3 because it is a simple operation that will significantly alter the value while still keeping it manageable.\n5. The calculation would be 425 * 3 = 1275.\n6.
