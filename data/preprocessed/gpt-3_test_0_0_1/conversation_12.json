The third digit of the number 357 is indeed 7, which is odd. Therefore, this was answered correctly.\n4. When asked if the resulting hash matched the calculated result after applying the transformation, the answer was NO, since the corrected result was 1194, not the initially provided 1317.\n\nTherefore, considering all the previously asked questions, they were correctly answered based on the number 357 and its transformation, except for the incorrect hash initially provided.\n\nIn summary:\n- Correctness of odd digit: Yes, correctly answered.\n- Transformation result check: No, initially incorrect hash provided.\n\nThus, the overarching answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is: NO."
