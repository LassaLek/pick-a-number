Multiply 356 by 3: \\(356 \\times 3 = 1068\\)\n2. Add 180: \\(1068 + 180 = 1248\\)\n\nIt seems I made an error, as the result 1248 does not match the original hash value of 1848. \n\nNO"

However, the transformation was incorrectly calculated, so the original hash didn't match, which might have led to confusion. If we're specifically addressing the second digit question, that part was answered correctly."
