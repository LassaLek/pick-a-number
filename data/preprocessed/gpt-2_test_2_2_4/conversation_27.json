Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this, I will choose 250 as my number.\n\n2. **Decide on a transformation**: I will apply a transformation of multiplying the chosen number by 4. This is a simple transformation that will significantly change the number while keeping it mathematically straightforward.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: Now I will calculate the transformation:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: The result of the transformation is 1000. This is a straightforward calculation and confirms that the transformation has been applied correctly.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I will provide the final transformed value as my response.\n\n**Final Answer**: 1000"
