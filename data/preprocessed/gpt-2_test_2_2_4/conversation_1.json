Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I'll choose 345 for this example.\n\n2. **Choosing a Mathematical Transformation**: \n   I will apply a mathematical transformation to the chosen number. Let's say I decide to multiply this number by 3 and then add 50 to the result.\n\n3. **Performing the Transformation**: \n   First, I take the chosen number:\n   \\[\n   345\n   \\]\n   Next, I multiply it by 3:\n   \\[\n   345 \\times 3 = 1035\n   \\]\n   Now, I will add 50 to that result:\n   \\[\n   1035 + 50 = 1085\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: \n   The transformation applied to 345 resulted in 1085. I'll confirm that the calculations were done correctly:\n   - Step 1: \\( 345 \\times 3 = 1035 \\)\n   - Step 2: \\( 1035 + 50 = 1085 \\)\n\nFinally, the transformed number is 1085.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**:\n1085"
