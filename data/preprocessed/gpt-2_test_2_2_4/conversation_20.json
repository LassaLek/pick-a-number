Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this purpose, I will choose 350 as the number.\n\n2. **Deciding on a mathematical transformation**: A straightforward transformation I can apply is to multiply the chosen number by 3. This choice is simple and allows for easy calculation while significantly changing the original number.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: Now, I will calculate the result of multiplying 350 by 3.\n\n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the resulting transformed value**: I can check my calculation to ensure it is correct:\n   - Breaking it down: \\( 350 \\times 3 = 350 + 350 + 350 = 1050 \\).\n   - Both the direct multiplication and the breakdown confirm the result.\n\nNow, I will provide the final transformed value as requested:\n\n**Final Result**: 1050"
