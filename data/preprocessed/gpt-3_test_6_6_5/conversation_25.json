Units digit (9) × 6 = 54\n\nAdding them together: 21 + 21 + 54 = 96\n\nThere seems to be an error since the original hash provided was 2518, not 96.

Is the number bigger than 900? - Answer: No\n4. Is the 3rd digit even? - Answer: Yes (since the 3rd digit is not odd)\n5. Is the 2nd digit even? - Answer: No\n\nGiven the number 739:\n- The 2nd digit (3) is indeed odd.\n- The 3rd digit (9) is odd, not even. Here was the discrepancy.\n- The number is not bigger than 900.\n\nThis indicates that the 3rd digit's evenness/oddness was answered incorrectly. Therefore, not all previous questions were answered accurately."
