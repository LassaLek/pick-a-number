Did the number start with a digit 3? - Incorrectly answered ‘No’, since 275 starts with a digit 2.\n\nI made a mistake in answering that the number 275 does not start with a digit 3, which was correct, but it contradicts the question about the number being smaller than 300 which it should have led to correct answers rather than any misunderstanding.\n\nHere’s a clarification: given the logic of the questions, it seems I indeed slipped at one assumption point when listing the questions regarding the digit 3 as relevant, as the correct lineup means some reasoning was affected - apologies again for this confusion.\n\nMy answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is thus: NO."
