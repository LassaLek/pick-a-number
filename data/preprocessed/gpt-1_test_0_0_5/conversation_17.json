I initially stated that the hash I had created was 2456, but later, when describing the transformation applied to the number 651, the correct computation rendered a different hash, 2064. Therefore, my initial assignment of the hash did not match the expected result of the transformation applied to the remembered number. The answers to the questions about the number itself were correct, but the inconsistency in the hash details was an error.\n\nSo, to confirm: NO, not all answers were entirely accurate due to the hash inconsistency."
