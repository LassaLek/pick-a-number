(Incorrect initially, clarified later)\n3. **Is the third digit of the number odd?** - Correctly responded with that the third digit is not odd after clarification. (Correct after clarification)\n4. **Is the number bigger than 900?** - Correctly answered no, 637 is not bigger than 900. (Correct)\n5. **Is the number smaller than 300?** - Correctly answered no, 637 is not smaller than 300. (Correct)\n\nTo answer your question: **NO**, all questions were not answered correctly initially due to a misunderstanding about the parity of the third digit, which was later corrected."
