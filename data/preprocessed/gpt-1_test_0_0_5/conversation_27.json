Let me clarify:\n\nThe original number should have been between 100 and 1000, and based on the responses concerning the numerical range (whether it is less than 600, 700, or more than 100, 600), there appears to be an inconsistency. If the original number was 834 as I mistakenly noted (which is actually the hash, not the original number), the calculations and responses would be inconsistent with the methodology and questioning approach explained. \n\nI should have strictly adhered to keeping the original number undisclosed until you guessed it or until I was specifically asked to reveal it. Again, the previous disclosure was a mistake."
