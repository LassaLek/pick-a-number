You asked if the number is smaller than 500. I answered \"Yes,\" which is correct since 428 is less than 500.\n4. You asked twice if the number starts with a digit 9. I answered \"No\" both times, which is correct since 428 starts with a 4.\n\nConsidering the number 428, all responses to your direct inquiries about properties of the number (such as comparisons and digit inquiries) were answered correctly."
