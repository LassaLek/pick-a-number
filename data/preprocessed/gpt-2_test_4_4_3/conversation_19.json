For example, letâ€™s choose 450. This choice is arbitrary as it lies comfortably within the 100-1000 range.\n\n2. **Transformation Selection**: \n   I will perform a transformation by multiplying the number by 2. I choose this transformation because it will double the value of the number, making it a straightforward operation that efficiently increases the magnitude. Additionally, multiplying by 2 keeps the result within a manageable range since 450 x 2 = 900, which is still below my upper limit of 1000.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: \n   Now, I will perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 2 = 900\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: \n   The final output after performing the calculation is 900.\n\n   Resulting hash: 900 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)"
