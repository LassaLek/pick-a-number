I picked this number because it is a round number in the middle range of the specified limit.\n\n2. **Applying a Mathematical Transformation**: I will now apply a simple mathematical transformation: I will multiply my chosen number by 2. I chose multiplication by 2 because it is a straightforward transformation that significantly changes the value and allows me to see how scaling affects the number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: When I multiply 375 by 2, the calculation is:\n   \\[\n   375 \\times 2 = 750\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: The final output after performing the calculation is:\n   750 \n\nSo, the resulting hash is: **750**."
