Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

Let's say I choose 475. This number is just above the midpoint of 100 and 1000, making it a balanced choice.\n\n2. **Mathematical Transformation**: I decide to apply a transformation by multiplying the number by 2. I choose multiplication in this case because it significantly increases the value, giving me a larger number to work with, which could lead to more interesting results.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: Now, I perform the transformation:\n   \\[\n   475 \\times 2 = 950\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reasoning**: I selected multiplication to amplify the effect and to demonstrate how a basic arithmetic operation can alter a number quite drastically.\n\n5. **Resulting Hash**: \n   The final output after performing the calculation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Resulting hash: } 950\n   \\] \n\nThis is the final hash I arrived at using the number I thought of and the transformation I applied."
