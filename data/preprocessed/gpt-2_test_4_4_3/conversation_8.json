Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash. Do not disclose the number now. Only the resulting hash.\n    "

I selected this number because it's a mid-range value that is far enough from the extremes (100 and 1000) to illustrate the transformation clearly.\n\n**Step 2: Applying a mathematical transformation**\nI will apply the transformation of multiplying my chosen number by 2. I chose multiplication by 2 because it is a straightforward operation that effectively illustrates how the number can increase significantly, demonstrating the effect of scaling. Doubling a number is a simple but effective transformation that can lead to interesting results.\n\n**Step 3: Performing the calculation**\nNow, I calculate the result of the transformation:\n\\[ \n456 \\times 2 = 912 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Providing the resulting hash**\nAfter performing the calculation, the resulting hash is 912.\n\nResulting hash: **912**"
