Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting, or using a more complex operation like squaring. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n     For example:\n     1. Chosen number: 150 (I chose this because itâ€™s a round number and easy to work with.)\n     2. Transformation: Multiply by 3 (I selected multiplication because it scales the number significantly while keeping calculations simple.)\n     3. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n     Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.\n     "

I chose to add 75 to the number 325 because I wanted to keep it within the same hundreds range (300-400) while also making the calculation relatively simple. Adding 75 is easy to calculate mentally and it would provide a moderate change to the original number.\n\n3. Resulting hash: 400. After adding 75 to 325, we get 400 as the final result. "
