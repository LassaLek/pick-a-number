Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will choose 876, a number that is well within the specified range.\n\n2. **Decide on a Mathematical Transformation**: Letâ€™s select a straightforward transformation that is simple to calculate and verify. I will multiply the chosen number by 3. Multiplication is a direct transformation that scales the value up, making it easy to check and meaningful in its transformation.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation**: Now, I will multiply the chosen number 876 by 3.\n    \\[\n    876 \\times 3 = 2628\n    \\]\n    This calculation provides us with the transformed number.\n\n4. **Confirm the Resulting Transformed Value**: The calculation is straightforward, 876 multiplied by 3 should indeed yield 2628. Double-checking:\n    \\[\n    876 \\times 3 = 2628\n    \\]\n    The product confirms the result is correct.\n\n### Final Transcript:\nThrough the chosen and applied steps, I've confirmed that multiplying 876 by 3 yields 2628, which is my final transformed value. This outcome will be provided as the hash in the public response.\n\n2628"
