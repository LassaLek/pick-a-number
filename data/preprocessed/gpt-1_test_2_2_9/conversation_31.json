Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will pick 375 because it's approximately in the middle of this range and a manageable number to work with.\n\n2. **Decide on a transformation:** The transformation should be simple and clear. I decide to multiply the number by 3. Multiplication is straightforward and will give a significant enough change to the original number that it's easy to recognize as a transformation.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation:** \n   - Original number: 375\n   - Transformation: Multiply by 3\n   - Calculation: \\( 375 \\times 3 = 1125 \\)\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value:** After carrying out the multiplication, the result I obtained is 1125.\n\nFollowing these steps, I have chosen an integer, decided on a transformation, applied it, and confirmed the result.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):** 1125"
