Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

To ensure the number is simple yet sufficiently random, I choose 250. This number is both easy to work with in terms of basic mathematical operations and falls comfortably within the given range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation:**\n   - I will use a combination of operations to make the transformation interesting yet straightforward. I decide to multiply the number by 3 and then add 50.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - First, multiply the chosen number (250) by 3:\n     \\( 250 \\times 3 = 750 \\)\n   - Following this, I add 50 to the result from the multiplication:\n     \\( 750 + 50 = 800 \\)\n   \n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:**\n   - The final transformed value, after applying the specified operations to the initial number, is 800.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):**\n800"
