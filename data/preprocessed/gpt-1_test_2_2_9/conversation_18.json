Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will choose the number 123 for simplicity and because it has a straightforward numerical structure which makes computations easy to follow.\n\n2. **Decide on a Mathematical Transformation:** I need to apply a simple mathematical transformation. I will choose to multiply the number by 3. Multiplication is a basic operation and multiplying by 3 provides a transformation that is significant enough to see a change, but still simple to calculate.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation:** Now, applying the transformation to the chosen number:\n   - \\( 123 \\times 3 = 369 \\)\n  \n4. **Confirm the Resulting Value:** The result of the transformation is 369. This is a direct multiplication without any further operations, ensuring the correctness of the outcome as long as the multiplication was done correctly.\n\n369"
