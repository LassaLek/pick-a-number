Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will choose to multiply this number by 4 for this example. So, the transformation can be described mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Transformed Value} = 250 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's perform this calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply 250 by 4.\n   \\[ 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\]\n\nThus, the resulting transformed value is 1000. \n\nNow that we've completed all the steps and confirmed the final transformed value, I'll output the answer as requested.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 1000"
