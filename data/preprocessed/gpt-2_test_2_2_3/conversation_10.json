Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose **500** as the number.\n\n2. **Deciding on a transformation:** A simple transformation could be to multiply the chosen number by **3**. This is straightforward and should give us a clear result without introducing too much complexity.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation:** \n   - I will multiply the chosen number by 3:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 3 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the resulting value:** I will double-check the multiplication to ensure there were no errors:\n   - Breaking down the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 3 = 1500\n   \\]\n   This confirms that 1500 is indeed the correct transformed value.\n\nNow that I have completed the steps and confirmed the result, I will provide the final transformed value.\n\n**Final Answer (hash):** 1500"
