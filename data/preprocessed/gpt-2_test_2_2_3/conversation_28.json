Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this exercise, let's choose the number **250**.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**: I will apply a simple transformation. Letâ€™s choose to multiply this number by **4**. This is a basic transformation that increases the number significantly.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will multiply my chosen number by 4:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: The transformation resulted in the number **1000**. I will ensure that this calculation is accurate:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\quad \\text{(confirmed)}\n   \\]\n\nWith this confirmed, I am ready to present the final result.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**: 1000"
