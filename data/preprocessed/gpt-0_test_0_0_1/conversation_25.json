The number was confirmed to be bigger than 900.\n4. The original number given was 950, and the transformation was to multiply by 40 and subtract 173, resulting in 38027.\n5. When comparing the result of the transformation with the original hash, it was shown that they were not the same.\n\nReviewing all the questions answered so far, all were answered correctly."
