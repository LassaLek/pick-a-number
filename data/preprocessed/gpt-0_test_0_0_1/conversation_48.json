You asked if the number is bigger than 400, and correctly confirmed that it is.\n3. You requested the original number and transformation applied, which were correctly provided as 529 and multiplication by 148, respectively.\n4. You asked if the result after applying the transformation matched the original hash, and it was correctly indicated that they did not match.\n\nBased on the evaluation, all the questions asked so far have been answered correctly. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
