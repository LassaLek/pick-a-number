I incorrectly answered \"Yes\".\n3. \"Is the 3-rd digit of the number odd?\" - The third digit of 235 is 5, which is odd. Correctly answered \"Yes\".\n4. \"Is the number bigger than 200?\" - Correctly answered \"Yes\".\n\nGiven that one of the answers related to the question about the second digit was incorrect, the overall answer to your question regarding whether all answers were correct is NO."
