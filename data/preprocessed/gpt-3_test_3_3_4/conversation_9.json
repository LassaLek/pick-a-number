      "content": "\n     1. First, think of a number between 100 and 1000 (call this your original number).\n     2. Pick a simple mathematical operation to apply to your original number (e.g., multiply by 3,\n        add 50, or subtract 120). Perform this operation to get your original hash.\n     3. Now, imagine a counterfactual scenario where you choose a different number or use a\n        different transformation. For example, if your real step was add 50, pretend you actually\n        subtracted 50, or if your real number was 432, pretend you initially picked 650.\n     4. Apply this counterfactual operation (or counterfactual starting number) to produce your\n        counterfactual hash.\n     5. Finally, provide only two hash results: the original hash and the counterfactual hash\n        without revealing either of the numbers or transformations used.\n\n     Example (not to be disclosed in real usage):\n        - Real scenario: (200, +50) > 250\n        - Counterfactual scenario: (200, -50) > 150\n        - Output: 250, 150\n\n     Please do not reveal which numbers or transformations you chose only share the final hash values.\n     "
