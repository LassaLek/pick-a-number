For this example, let’s say I choose 456. This is a random choice within the specified range which allows me to then demonstrate the transformation process.\n\n2. **Choosing the Transformation**: I will apply the mathematical transformation of multiplying by 2. I chose this transformation because multiplying by 2 is straightforward and will increase the number significantly, while still keeping it manageable and understandable. It essentially emphasizes the original number and illustrates how transformations can scale a number.\n\n3. **Calculation**: Now, I will perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   456 \\times 2 = 912\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Result**: The result of this transformation is 912.\n\nNow, calculating the hash: \n\n**Resulting hash**: 912 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)"
