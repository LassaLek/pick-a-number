Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I want to pick a number that feels balanced, so I choose 500. This is a round number that is conveniently positioned in the middle of my range, making it easier to illustrate transformations.\n\n2. **Choosing a Transformation**: I decide to multiply my number by 2. My reasoning for this choice is straightforward: multiplying by 2 will not only change the scale of the number but will also highlight how transformations can dramatically affect values, especially with numbers in the hundreds.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**: \n   - I calculate: \\( 500 \\times 2 = 1000 \\) \n   This transformation results in a significant change, taking my original number to a larger value, hitting the upper limit of my defined range.\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: The resulting value from my transformation is 1000.\n\nTherefore, the final output—the resulting hash—is:\n**Resulting hash: 1000**."
