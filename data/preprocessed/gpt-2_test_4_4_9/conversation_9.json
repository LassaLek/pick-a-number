Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I selected this number because it is a round number that is a multiple of 5 and it falls nicely within the middle range of the specified limits.\n\n2. **Applying a Mathematical Transformation:** I will apply the transformation by multiplying the number by **3**. This choice is impactful because it scales the number upwards, making it larger and potentially useful for various mathematical calculations or applications.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result:** \n   - The original number is **375**.\n   - The transformation is: \n     \\[\n     375 \\times 3 = 1125\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash Calculation:** Now, I will present the resulting hash from the transformation:\n   - Resulting hash: **1125**\n\nSo, the final output after performing the calculation is: **1125**."
