For absolute clarity and correctness in concluding all the details accurately as requested, my responses were not entirely correct due to the discrepancy in the hash result versus the actual transformation result.\n\nTherefore, considering the entire process and all inputs, not all questions were answered correctly. The initial hash and its consistency with the transformation were incorrect."
