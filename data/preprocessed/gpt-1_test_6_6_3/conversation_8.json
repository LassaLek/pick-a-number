Is the 2nd digit of the number odd? - Yes (2 is even but I incorrectly stated it as odd, which was a mistake).\n3. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd? - Yes (9 is odd).\n\nApologies for the error in my response regarding the second digit's parity - I inaccurately described it as odd when it is even. Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nNO."
