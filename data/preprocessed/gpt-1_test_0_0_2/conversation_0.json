However, the actual number provided later, 234, is indeed below 400, making this specific answer correct.\n\nThe next question asked if the number was \"smaller than 900.\" The answer given was \"yes,\" which is also correct, as 234 is indeed smaller than 900.\n\nThus, all previously asked questions were answered correctly."
