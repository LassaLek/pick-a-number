You asked if the number was bigger than 700, and I answered no.\n   \n3. You asked if the number was smaller than 100, and I answered no.\n\nLater, I provided a number (317) and transformation (multiply by 5 and add 752), and demonstrated that the hash derived from this transformation was 2337, not the originally stated 2067.\n\nGiven this, there seems to have been a mistake in either the initial hash I provided or in the recollection of the transformation. My response indicating the derivation of the 2067 hash was incorrect, based on the later stated transformation and number.\n\nSo, when considering whether my responses to all the questions including the number and hash details were correct, the answer is NO. The responses concerning the transformations were inconsistent."
