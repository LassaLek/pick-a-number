I initially claimed a hash of 1521 from a transformation.\n2. Later, when revealing the number as 123 and the transformation \\( n \\times 12 + 21 \\), leading to a different result of 1497, which contradicts the hash I initially gave.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems there was a mistake in my responses either about the number, the transformation, or the original hash. Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly based on the inconsistency in the details provided.\n\nThe answer to your question, considering this explanation, is NO."
