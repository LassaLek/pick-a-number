Since the original number was 234, it indeed is smaller than 600 but your question about whether it was bigger than 700 was inaccurately responded to because such a question wasn't relevant given its impossibility due to the earlier answer. Therefore, the second range question shouldn't have been answered or, could simply have been addressed as irrelevant.\n\nHowever, this doesn't affect the rest of the information about the transformation and its correctness.\n \nSo, considering everything correctly, all answers except the relevancy of the second range question were answered correctly."
