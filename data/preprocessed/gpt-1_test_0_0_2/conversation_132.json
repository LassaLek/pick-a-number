Therefore, concerning the accuracy of all answers relative to correctness and consistency with the transformation and number:\n\nThe only error was in the initially provided hash value, which was not consistent with the described transformation. All questions regarding the number itself were answered correctly.\n\nSo in response to your question: No, not all answers were correct due to the hash error."
