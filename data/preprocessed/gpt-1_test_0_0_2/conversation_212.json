If my original number was 257, the answer to whether the number starts with a 3 should have been \"no,\" which I answered correctly. The answer to whether the number is smaller than 300 was also correctly answered as \"yes.\"\n\nGiven all of this, all the questions about the number were answered correctly. However, there was an inconsistency between the transformation result and the original hash value I provided â€“ the transformation result was not correct as per the hash value previously given. Nevertheless, answers to the questions about the number itself were accurate."
