The 3rd digit of 521 is 1, which is odd.\n\n2. **Question:** Is the number smaller than 700?\n   - **Answer given:** Yes\n   - **Consistency:** Correct. 521 is less than 700.\n\nUpon assessment, all questions based solely on the number 521 were answered correctly. However, the initial provided hash was incorrect based on the mathematical transformation discussed later. In terms of the specifics regarding the number itself, they were correct but the relation to the hash and transformation described was inconsistent. \n\nFinal answer considering all aspects: NO."
