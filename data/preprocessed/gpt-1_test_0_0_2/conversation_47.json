My initial response indicated that the number is not smaller than 500, which was misleading given the second question asked specifically if the number was smaller than 400. The discrepancy implied an incorrect yes/no format in relation to the actual number provided (875), which indeed is not smaller than 500 or 400. However, the inconsistency in confirming straightforwardly might have led to confusion. My apologies for any misunderstanding."
