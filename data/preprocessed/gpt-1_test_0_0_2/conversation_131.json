For 528, this is **correct**.\n3. **Is the 3rd digit of the number even?** I answered **Yes**. The 3rd digit of 528 is 8, which is even, so this is **correct**.\n\nYes, all the previously asked questions were answered correctly regarding the number 528 and its properties based on what was revealed through the questions."
