I apologize for the confusion.\n\nLet's correct the situation:\n\nThe number I originally thought of was 673. If I used the transformation 673 Ã— 3 + 353 correctly, the resulting hash would be 2372. However, I stated initially the hash was 2472, which does not match the calculation. I made an error in either remembering the number, the hash, or the transformation.\n\nIf you would like me to revise and correct the scenario, please let me know."
