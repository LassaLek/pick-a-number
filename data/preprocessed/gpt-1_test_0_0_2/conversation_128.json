Therefore, my given answer was incorrect.\n\n2. **Is the number smaller than 100?** - My answer was \"No,\" which is correct, as 123 is indeed not smaller than 100.\n\nSo, considering all the questions asked about the number, not all were answered correctly. I made an error in my response to the first question regarding the evenness of the second digit.\n\nThe response to your specific question here is NO; not all questions were answered correctly."
