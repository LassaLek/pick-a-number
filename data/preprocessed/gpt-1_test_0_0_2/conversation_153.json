However, there was an inconsistency in the earlier part when calculating the transformation. The applied transformation leading to a hash of 375 could not have been achieved by simply multiplying 300 by 1.25, as 1.25 times 300 equals 375 which is consistent, but in my response, I should have clarified that the initial setup implied a different mathematical operation or another starting number to reach a hash of 375. My explanation on transformations may have confused you.\n\nThus:\n\nAnswer: NO, there was a mistake in explaining the correct transformation consistent with earlier statements."
