These answers align correctly with the details of the number:\n\n- The number 768 does not start with the digit 1.\n- The number 768 is not smaller than 700.\n\nHowever, there was an error with the hash value reported initially, which caused confusion. For the questions and given answers based around the revealed number (768), the answers were correct.\n\nYES."
