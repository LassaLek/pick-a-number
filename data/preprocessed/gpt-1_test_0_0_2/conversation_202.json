I provided a hash of 807.\n- **Question 2:** You asked if the number was bigger than 100. I confirmed correctly.\n- **Question 3:** You asked if the number was bigger than 200. I confirmed correctly.\n\nHowever, the inconsistency lies in the hash provided initially (807) and the operation applied later (which resulted in 717 instead). Therefore, while the responses to your direct questions about the number range were correct, the information associated with the hash was incorrect.\n\nConsidering this, my responses were not completely accurate in terms of consistency and correctness of the hash value."
