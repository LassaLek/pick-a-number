Is the number bigger than 200? - Correctly answered as Yes.\n\nConsidering the transformation was initially provided incorrectly, let me clarify to ensure all information fits together consistently:\nIf the number used in the transformation (379) is multiplied by 4, the result should have been 1516 as correctly recalculated, and not 1518 which I mistakenly provided before. Hence, the initial stage of providing the hash result was incorrect.\n\nBut all the answers regarding the characteristics of the number (its size relative to 200 and 800) are correct.\n\nYES, all previously asked questions about the number itself were answered correctly. The mistake was in the initial hash provided."
