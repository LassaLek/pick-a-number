Is the number smaller than 400?\n\nGiven the actual number was 789:\n- The answer to the first question (\"Is the number bigger than 600?\") should be YES, and that was answered correctly.\n- The answer to the second question (\"Is the number smaller than 400?\") should be NO, and that was also answered correctly.\n\nTherefore, all the questions about the number were answered correctly. The error was in the originally provided hash and the calculation revealed in the explanation, which was inconsistent with the initial hash number provided."
