My answer was \"Yes,\" which is correct.\n\n2. **Is the number smaller than 200?**\n   - The number 431 is not smaller than 200. My answer was \"No,\" which is correct.\n\nGiven these considerations, all the previously asked questions were answered correctly based on the number 431. Therefore, the final answer to your inquiry is YES."
