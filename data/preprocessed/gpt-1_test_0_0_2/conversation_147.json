The answer to the question \"Is the 1-st digit of the number even?\" is correctly \"Yes.\"\n- The second digit is 4, which is even. However, I mistakenly answered \"Yes\" when asked if the second digit of the number is odd, which should have been \"No.\"\n\nConsidering this, the answer to whether all the previously asked questions were answered correctly is NO. My earlier response to the question about the second digit being odd was incorrect."
