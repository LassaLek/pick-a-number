I confirmed the first digit of the original number is odd (7 is odd).\n4. The original number was 763, and the transformation was multiplying by 5, resulting in 3815.\n\nGiven the misalignment in the initial hash (3828 vs 3815), my initial hash provided was incorrect regarding the transformation described. Therefore, the initial hash I provided did not align with the described transformation and the original number.\n\nThus, my original hash mistake impacts the integrity of the follow-up answers for the hash value.\n\nOverall, the transformations and descriptions surrounding the original number were correct (odd, not starting with 1, etc.), but I must admit an error in the initial hash provided (3828 instead of 3815).\n\nSo, not all the questions were answered correctly."
