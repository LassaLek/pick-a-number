I apologize for the mistake. Let's correct this:\n\n**Correct Number:** 756\n**Correct Transformation:** Multiply by 0.5\n**Resulting Hash from Correct Transformation:** 378\n\nThis hash does comply with everything said before (hash result and the number being greater than 600). All answers align correctly with these corrected values."
