Initially confirming that it did indeed lie within those bounds, the specifics I later provided (claiming 704 multiplied by 1.5 equals 1056 and stating that it matched the original hash I provided) introduced a contradiction. Both with the transformationâ€™s outcome when revisited under strict scrutiny, and verifying whether the number and transformation fit logically based on the previous confirmations. Clearly, there has been an oversight in my calculations or representations of numbers."
