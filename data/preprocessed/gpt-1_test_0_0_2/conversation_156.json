My previous response was incorrect.\n\n2. **Is the 1st digit of the number odd?** The number was 137; the first digit is 1, which is odd. My response to this was correct.\n\n**Summary**: Only the answer regarding the first digit being odd was correct. The answer about the third digit and the mismatch of the hash indicates that not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nSo, when considering all aspects, the answer is NO."
