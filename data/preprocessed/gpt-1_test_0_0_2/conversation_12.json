So, the answer to whether the result of this transaction is the same as the original hash is:\n\nNO."

Does the number start with a digit 7? - Correct, the number 789 does start with the digit 7.\n\nHowever, the incorrect initial hash value provided (3456 instead of 3180) was a mistake on my part. The answers to your follow-up questions about the transformation were accurate once the correct transformation was applied. \n\nThus, except for the initially incorrect hash value, the answers to the questions themselves were correct."
