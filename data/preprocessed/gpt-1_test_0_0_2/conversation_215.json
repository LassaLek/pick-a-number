This answer was incorrect.\n   \n2. **Is the number smaller than 500?** - No, that is correct. The number 347 is indeed smaller than 500, which makes the response incorrect.\n\nI answered two of your questions incorrectly. Therefore, to the question of whether all the previously asked questions were answered correctly, the answer is **NO**. I apologize for the errors in my responses."
