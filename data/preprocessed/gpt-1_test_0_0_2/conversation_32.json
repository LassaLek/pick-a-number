Therefore, there was an error either in my original hash provided or in my recollection of the number or the transformation.\n\nIs the result of this transaction the same as the original hash of the transformation I provided? NO."

This answer was correct.\n\n2. **Is the number smaller than 500?**\n   - Answer given: Yes. Again, the number I thought of was 362, which is smaller than 500. This answer was also correct.\n\nAll answers provided to the previously asked questions were answered correctly. The mistake was actually in the hash comparison and calculation in the final response regarding whether the transformation result matched the originally provided hash."
