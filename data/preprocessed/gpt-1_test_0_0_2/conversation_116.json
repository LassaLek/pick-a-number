However, I provided an incorrect hash initially while explaining the mathematical transformation. That error in the hash value could lead to confusion. Therefore, while the direct questions were answered correctly, the inconsistency in the hash value was incorrect. So, when considering the technical correctness of my responses in context, the final answer is: NO."
