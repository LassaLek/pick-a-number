Therefore, the responses to the questions based on that erroneous hash may have impacted the accuracy of the yes/no answers pertaining to the original number.\n\nRevisiting the responses with the correct transformation would likely have changed the answers:\n\n1. **Is the number bigger than 700?** - Correct response was given as NO.\n2. **Does the number start with a digit 9?** - Correct response was given as NO.\n\nSo, in this context, the provided answers to these questions were indeed correct. However, the inconsistency arises from the mismatch between the original hash and the recalculated hash. Thus, the original hash question was not correctly aligned. \n\nOverall, the specific questions about the number properties were answered correctly, but the provided hash and linked calculations were incorrect."
