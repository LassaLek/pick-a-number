Answers to both those questions should have been \"yes\" and \"no,\" respectively, and they were correctly answered as such.\n\nIn summary, all of the questions considering the number 192 were answered correctly based on the replies given:\n\n1. Is the number bigger than 700? No (Answered correctly)\n2. Is the number smaller than 100? No (Answered correctly)\n\nThe responses were accurate based on these questions and answers."
