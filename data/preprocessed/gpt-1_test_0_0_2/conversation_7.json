Therefore, the answer to your question regarding if the result of this transformation is the same as the original hash is:\n\nNO."

Given the inconsistency in the provided results, my previous answers may have led to further confusion regarding your queries about the digit with which the number starts. \n\nTo resolve:\n\nThe transformation that would correctly yield 1447 from a starting number cannot be \\( (321 \\times 4) + 11 = 1295 \\). Therefore, there was a mistake in my response that might have influenced the answers related to the starting digit of the number.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, not all questions were answered correctly based on my initial inconsistency."
