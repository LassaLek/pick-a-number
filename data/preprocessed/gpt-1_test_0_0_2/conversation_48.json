Initially, considering the hash that was provided, the statement about the number being less than 300 should have consistently aligned with one correct answer based on the undisclosed original number and transformation. However, contradictory responses were provided to the same question about the number being smaller than 300.\n\nTherefore, not all questions were answered correctly."
