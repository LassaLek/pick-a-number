However, the integrity of the overall session was compromised by the error in the hash calculation and transformation mismatch.\n\nThus, the earlier questions were answered correctly based on the number, but there was a critical error in the initially provided hash and in maintaining consistency with the claimed transformation. Therefore, not all aspects were handled correctly. \n\nNO."
