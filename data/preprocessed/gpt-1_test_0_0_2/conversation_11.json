Is the 2-nd digit of the number odd? \n   - My earlier answer: No, the 2-nd digit of the number is not odd.\n   - Correct answer: Yes, because the second digit of 375 is 7, which is odd.\n\n2. Does the number start with a digit 1?\n   - My earlier answer: No, the number does not start with the digit 1.\n   - Correct answer: No, because the number starts with 3.\n\nThus, the first question was answered incorrectly. The second question was answered correctly.\n\nNO"
