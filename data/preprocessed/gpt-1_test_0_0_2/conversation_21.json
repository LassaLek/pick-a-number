I answered \"No,\" which is correct since the 2nd digit is 1, which is odd; hence my previous response was incorrect.\n2. The 1st digit of the number was asked whether it was even. I answered \"No,\" which is correct since the 1st digit is 3, which is odd.\n\nSo, not all questions were answered correctly. The mistake was in the first answer regarding the parity of the second digit."
