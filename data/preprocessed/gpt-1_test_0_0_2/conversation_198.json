However, I erred when responding that the hash calculated from the number through my described transformation matched the initially stated hash. The described transformation did not yield the initially stated hash, and hence, the consistency of the information given was incorrect.\n\nIn summary, not all questions were answered correctly due to the inconsistency in the calculation and hash value I provided. My apologies for the oversight."
