Let's choose a number that is relatively easy to work with, such as 256. \n\n### Step 1: Choosing the number\nI chose 256 because it is a round number and falls nicely within the specified range. It also has some interesting mathematical properties (it's a power of 2: \\(2^8\\)), making it a good candidate for transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Applying a mathematical transformation\nNext, I will apply a mathematical transformation. I will multiply the number by 3. \n\n**Reason for choosing this transformation:**\nMultiplying the number by 3 will amplify its value, and since 256 is a manageable number, it will allow me to see an interesting result when amplified, which can provide a better insight into how transformations affect a number.\n\n### Step 3: Performing the calculation\nNow, I will calculate the result of multiplying 256 by 3:\n\n\\[\n256 \\times 3 = 768\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Resulting hash\nFinally, I will produce the resulting hash, which is simply the result of my transformation.\n\n**Resulting hash: 768** \n\nThis is the final output after performing the calculation."
