I selected this number because it is a multiple of 10, making it easier to perform calculations.\n\n2. **Applying a Transformation**: Now, I will decide on a transformation. I will multiply the number by 3. The reason for choosing multiplication by 3 is that it's a simple yet impactful operation that will significantly change the value of the original number, allowing me to demonstrate the transformation's effect clearly.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: Now, I will compute the result of this transformation:\n   \\[\n   420 \\times 3 = 1260\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Resulting Hash**: The final output after performing the calculation is 1260, and this will be considered my resulting hash.\n\nResulting hash: **1260**."
