Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will choose the number **350**.\n\nNext, I will decide on a simple mathematical transformation. I will opt to multiply the chosen number by **3** and then add **50** to the result. This transformation is straightforward and provides a clear pathway to a new value.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Multiplication by 3**: \n   - 350 * 3 = 1050\n\n2. **Addition of 50**:\n   - 1050 + 50 = 1100\n\nNow, I will confirm the resulting transformed value. The final result after applying the selected transformation is **1100**.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed value (hash) is:\n\n**1100**"
