Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will choose to **add 150** to the selected number. This transformation is straightforward and will yield a positive result.\n\nNow let's apply the transformation:\n\n1. **Original Number**: 256\n2. **Transformation**: Add 150\n3. **Calculation**: 256 + 150 = 406\n\nNext, I'll confirm the resulting transformed value, which is **406**.\n\nFinally, the transformed value, or the final hash, is:\n\n406"
