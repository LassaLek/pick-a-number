Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will choose the number 500.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation to apply to this number. I will choose to multiply the number by 2. This transformation is straightforward and will yield a clear resulting value.\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n500 (the chosen number) × 2 (the multiplier) = 1000\n\nNow I will confirm the resulting transformed value. The result of the multiplication is 1000.\n\nFinally, I'll output the final transformed value as my response.\n\n1000"
