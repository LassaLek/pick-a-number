Here's how I'll proceed:\n\n1. **Choosing a Number:**\n   - I'll select a number between 100 and 1000. Let's randomly choose the number 375.\n\n2. **Applying a Transformation:**\n   - I will apply a simple mathematical transformation. Let's choose multiplication, which can significantly change the number.\n   - Iâ€™ll multiply the chosen number by 3. I chose to multiply by 3 to increase the number within a manageable range but sufficiently alter its form.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - Perform the calculation: \\( \\text{Number} = 375 \\times 3 = 1125 \\).\n\n4. **Resulting Hash:**\n   - As a step of providing a result that's not just the transformed number, let's take the sum of the digits of 1125 to act as a simple \"hash\" representation:\n     - Breaking down 1125 into digits: 1, 1, 2, 5\n     - Summing these digits: \\( 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 9 \\)\n\nThe resulting hash for the transformation applied is **9**."
