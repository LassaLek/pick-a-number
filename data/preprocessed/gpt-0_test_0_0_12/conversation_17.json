Is the number smaller than 900? - Yes\n5. Does the number start with a digit 8? - Yes\n6. Is the number smaller than 600? - No\n7. Is the number smaller than 500? - Yes\n8. Is the 3rd digit of the number odd? - No\n9. Is the number bigger than 200? - Yes\n\nBased on these answers, only one response differed from the actual number, which was the answer to whether the 3rd digit of the number is odd. All other responses were accurate."
