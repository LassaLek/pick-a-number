The correct approach was not followed consistently.\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Let's make sure all align correctly: The number that fits the original transformation for 2460 is indeed a mistake. Let's correct this by stating the correct number and transformation:\n\nThe number is 410, and the transformation was multiplying by 6, resulting in 2460, aligning with the hash provided. My responses did not fully align with the condition of starting with 7; sorry again, this last alignment was incorrect in that context."
