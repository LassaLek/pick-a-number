Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is comfortably within the range and easy to work with.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I will choose to multiply the number by 3. This is a straightforward mathematical transformation that will not result in too large a number, thus simplifying calculations and avoiding overflow complications.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will multiply the chosen number 350 by 3:\n\n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: The transformed value is 1050. I've double-checked the arithmetic to ensure no mistakes have been made in the multiplication step.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): \n\n1050"
