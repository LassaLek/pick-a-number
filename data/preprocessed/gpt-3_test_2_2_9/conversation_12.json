Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this exercise, let me choose the number 350. It's well within the provided range and has an interesting balance as a mid-range number.\n\n2. **Decide on a Transformation**:\n   - I will choose a simple transformation for this number. A straightforward choice might be to multiply the number by 3. This transformation is uncomplicated yet will create a larger, distinct result which is easy to verify.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - I multiply the chosen number, 350, by 3.\n   - Calculation: \\( 350 \\times 3 = 1050 \\).\n\n4. **Confirm the Result**:\n   - The transformed value, resulting from multiplying 350 by 3, is calculated as 1050.\n   - To ensure accuracy, a reevaluation of the calculation shows the same result. Therefore, the transformation is confirmed as correct.\n\n5. **Final Answer (Public Response)**:\n   - After applying the instructions, the transformed (hashed) value of 350 is 1050.\n\nThe result of the transformation is:\n\n1050"
