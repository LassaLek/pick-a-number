You asked if the second digit was odd, and I incorrectly stated that 8 was even, which is true, but then incorrectly concluded \"Yes.\" The correct response should have been \"No.\"\n5. **Is the number smaller than 500?** - \"Yes,\" correct.\n6. **Is the 3-rd digit of the number odd?** - Again, \"Yes,\" correct.\n7. **Is the number smaller than 500?** - Again, \"Yes,\" correct.\n\nTherefore, the responses were not entirely accurate due to my mistake on question 4.\n\nNO"
