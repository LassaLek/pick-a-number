Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

This number is centrally located within the range and is easy to work with mathematically, as it's also a multiple of 50, making calculations simpler.\n\n2. **Applying a transformation**: I will choose to multiply this number by 2. I selected this transformation because it scales the number up, allowing us to see how the original number can expand while remaining within the realm of straightforward calculations.\n\n3. **Calculating the result**: \n   - Original number: 450\n   - Transformation: 450 × 2 = 900\n\n4. **Resulting hash**: Now, I will provide the resulting hash based on the transformed number. The final output is:\n\n   **Resulting hash: 900**"
