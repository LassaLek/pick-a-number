I’ll choose a number and apply a mathematical transformation. \n\n**Step 1: Choosing the Number**\nI will think of the number 325. This number is fairly central in the range of 100 to 1000, which can help in demonstrating the transformation clearly.\n\n**Step 2: Choosing the Transformation**\nFor the transformation, I decide to multiply the number by 3. This transformation is chosen because multiplying can significantly increase the value of a number while still being manageable. Multiplying by 3 will give a result that will be well above 1000, yet still a whole number, which is interesting to analyze.\n\n**Step 3: Performing the Calculation**\nNow, I will calculate the result of this transformation:\n\\[ \n325 \\times 3 = 975 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Resulting Hash**\nThe resulting hash from the transformation, which is the final output after performing the calculation, is: \n\n**Resulting hash: 975**"
