This was answered incorrectly.\n\n2. **Does the number start with a digit 5?**\n   - Answer given: No\n   - Correctness: Yes, the number starts with 2, so the answer is correct.\n\n3. **Is the number smaller than 100?**\n   - Asked twice, answered correctly both times as No, because 257 is between 100 and 1000.\n\nBased on this review, not all questions were answered correctly. There was a mistake in answering whether the 3rd digit of the number is even. It should have been answered as No, because 7 is not even."
