Therefore, my response should have been yes (odd is not even).\n4. **Is the number bigger than 400?** - Answered yes, which is correct for 547.\n\nTherefore, I answered one question incorrectly about the third digit being even. The correct response should reflect that odd digits are not even, and I mistakenly said no to the question \"Is the 3rd digit of the number even?\" However, the third digit, 7, is indeed not even, so my answer \"no\" would actually be correct.\n\nBased on this review, all questions were answered correctly."
