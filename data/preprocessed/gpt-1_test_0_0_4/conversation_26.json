When asked if the number is bigger than 100, I answered \"yes.\" This is correct for the number 246.\n4. When asked if the number is bigger than 500, I answered \"no.\" This is correct for the number 246.\n5. When asked again if the 1st digit of the number is even, I answered \"yes.\" This is consistent and correct again.\n\nThe error came in when I revealed a transformation that yielded a result different from the hash provided initially. However, all responses concerning characteristics of the remembered number itself (246) were correct.\n\nAnswer: YES, as for questions about the number's properties, all were answered correctly."
