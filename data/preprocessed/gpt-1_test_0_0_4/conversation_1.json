This was incorrect; I apologize for the error. \n3. \"Does the number start with a digit 5?\" - **No**. Correct, as it starts with 2.\n4. \"Is the 1st digit of the number even?\" - **Yes**. Correct, as the first digit is 2, which is even.\n\nGiven that there was a mistake in the answer to the third digit question (answered as odd instead of even), not all questions were answered correctly.\n\nNO."
