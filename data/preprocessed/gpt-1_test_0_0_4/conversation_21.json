Also, one of the questions regarding the number's relation to a range (smaller than 800 or 900) was redundant given the number's range from 100 to 1000, which could have been misleading, and there was inconsistency regarding the hash calculation. \n\nSo, not all questions were answered correctly based on the final verification."
