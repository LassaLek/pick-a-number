I apologize, but my response here was incorrect.\n\n3. **Is the number smaller than 600?**  \n   I answered: Yes.  \n   Correct, since 276 is smaller than 600.\n\n4. **Is the number smaller than 800?**  \n   I answered: Yes.  \n   Correct again, since 276 is also smaller than 800.\n\nTo answer your question: All of the questions were not answered correctly. I made an error in the second question about the second digit being even. It should have been answered as \"No\" instead of \"Yes\"."
