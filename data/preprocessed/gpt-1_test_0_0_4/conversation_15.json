Is the number bigger than 300? - **Yes.** (Correct, as 512 is more than 300.)\n3. Is the 1st digit of the number odd? - **Yes.** (Correct, the first digit is 5, which is odd.)\n4. Is the number smaller than 500? - **No.** (Correct, as 512 is greater than 500.)\n\nBased on the number 512 and the transformation described, all previously asked questions about it were answered correctly. YES."
