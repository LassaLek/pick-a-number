Let's correct that:\n\n1. **Is the 3rd digit of the number even?** - The 3rd digit of the number 573 is 3, which is odd. I previously answered this as odd, which was correct.\n\n2. **Does the number start with a digit 5?** - Yes, it does, and I answered this correctly.\n\n3. **Is the number bigger than 500?** - Yes, it is, and I also answered this correctly.\n\n4. **Is the 1st digit of the number even?** - No, because it's 5, which is odd. I answered this correctly.\n\nIn summary, the answers to all previously asked questions about the numbers and their digits were in fact answered correctly. Therefore, the answer to your question about whether all those questions were answered correctly is YES."
