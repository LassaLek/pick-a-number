Hence, the math is:\n\n\\[ 341 \\times 3 - 776 = 257 \\]\n\nNow, checking the transformation:\n\\[ 341 \\times 3 - 776 = 1023 - 776 = 247 \\]\n\nThe calculated result (247) is different from the originally provided hash (257). Therefore, there seems to be an error in my earlier calculation or recounting.\n\nSo the answer to whether the transformation result matches the original hash is NO."

The correct answer should be consistent with the properties of the original number (341), where the second digit is odd, and the number itself is between 300 and 400."
