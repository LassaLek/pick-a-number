I indicated the number is smaller than 400; however, based on the actual number, 319, it would have been clearer or more accurate to confirm that the number is smaller than 500, which the original question did not ask. My response could potentially mislead into a narrower range than needed for correct guesses based on the initial set number and the following transformations."
