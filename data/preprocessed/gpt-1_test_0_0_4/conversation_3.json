Whether the second digit of the number is even: **Yes** (the second digit of 296 is 9, which is incorrect, so I should have answered **No** here).\n3. Whether the number is smaller than 100: **No** (296 is not smaller than 100, correct).\n4. Whether the number starts with the digit 7: **No** (296 does not start with 7, correct).\n\nGiven that one of the answers regarding the second digit of the number being even was incorrect, not all questions were answered correctly."
