Is the number greater than 100 (\"Is the number bigger than 100\"): The answer \"Yes\" is correct.\n3. 1st digit's parity (\"Is the 1st digit of the number even?\"): The 1st digit of 234 is 2, which is even. I correctly answered \"Yes.\"\n4. 3rd digit's parity again (\"Is the 3rd digit of the number even?\"): The answer \"No\" contradicts my earlier \"Yes\" to the same question about odd parity. The correct answer confirming even parity was \"Yes.\"\n\nThus, some questions were not answered correctly. \n\nAnswer: NO."
