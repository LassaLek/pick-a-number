Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This choice is arbitrary but ensures it lies within the specified range.\n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation for this number. I will choose to add a specific number to it. For this transformation, I will add **150**. \n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:\n\n1. Original number: **250**\n2. Transformation: **Add 150**\n3. Calculation: \n   \\[\n   250 + 150 = 400\n   \\]\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the resulting transformed value is **400**. \n\nConfirming this, the transformation has been correctly applied, and the final result (hash) is:\n\n**400**"

The 3rd digit (the rightmost digit) is **0**.\n\nKnowing that **0** is an even number, we conclude that the 3rd digit of **400** is indeed even. \n\nThus, the answer to your question is: **Yes**, the 3rd digit is even."
