Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I'll choose to multiply the number by 4. This transformation is straightforward and allows for easy calculation.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation to the chosen number:\n\n1. Start with the chosen number: 250.\n2. Multiply by 4: \n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\nNext, I will confirm the resulting transformed value. The calculation above gives us 1000.\n\nNow, I will present the final transformed value as my response.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 1000"
