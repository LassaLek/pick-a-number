Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Decide on a mathematical transformation: I'll opt for a simple additive transformation, which will be to add 144 to the selected number. This approach is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic.\n\n3. Apply the transformation: Now, I will apply the transformation by adding 144 to 256.\n\n   \\[\n   256 + 144 = 400\n   \\]\n\n4. Confirm the resulting transformed value: I performed the addition, and the math checks out correctly. The result is indeed 400.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response): 400"
