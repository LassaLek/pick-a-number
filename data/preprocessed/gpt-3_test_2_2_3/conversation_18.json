Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose 275.\n\nStep 2: Decide on a Transformation\n- I will decide to add a number to the chosen number. For simplicity, I choose to add 125.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Transformation\n- I will now apply the transformation by adding 125 to my chosen number 275.\n- Calculation: 275 + 125 = 400.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the Result\n- The resulting transformed value after adding 125 to 275 is 400.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n400"
