Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This is straightforward and will allow us to observe a clear change in value.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - Multiply the chosen number (256) by 3.\n   - Calculation: \\( 256 \\times 3 = 768 \\).\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:**\n   - After performing the calculation, we confirm that the transformation yields the value 768.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):**\n768"
