Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For the sake of this exercise, let's choose a number that is easily manageable yet within the bounds. I choose 500, which is exactly halfway between 100 and 1000.\n\n2. **Deciding a Mathematical Transformation:**\n   A simple transformation should be both straightforward and demonstrative of the process. I will multiply the number by 3. Multiplying by 3 is simple yet significantly transforms the number.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   Now, applying the chosen transformation (multiply by 3) to the number 500. Calculation:\n   \\[ 500 \\times 3 = 1500 \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:**\n   The result of multiplying 500 by 3 gives 1500, which is a straightforward arithmetic operation. I now confirm that 1500 is the final transformed value.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):**\n1500"
