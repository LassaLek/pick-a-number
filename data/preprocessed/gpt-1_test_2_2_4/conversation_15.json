Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

To make it a clear-cut example, I'll choose 500, which is exactly halfway between 100 and 1000, making calculations straightforward and easier to verify.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**: We need to apply a simple transformation such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, etc. Utilizing multiplication will provide a clear transformation that is easy to interpret. Multiplying by 3 is a straightforward choice that significantly changes the number but keeps calculations simple.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Multiplying the chosen number, 500, by 3 results in 500 * 3 = 1500. \n\n4. **Confirm the Transformed Value**: The result of multiplying 500 by 3 indeed gives us 1500.\n\nFinal answer following these logical steps:\n1500"
