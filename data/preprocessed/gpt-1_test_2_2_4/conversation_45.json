Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For simplicity and clarity, I will choose the number 500.\n\nStep 2: Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation\nTo demonstrate a clear transformation, I'll choose something explicit and easy to calculate. Let's decide to multiply the chosen number by 3. Multiplying by a factor provides a clear, proportional change that's easy to verify.\n\nStep 3: Applying the Transformation\nNow, apply the chosen transformation to the number 500. The operation is multiplication by 3.\nCalculation: 500 × 3 = 1500\n\nStep 4: Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value\nThe result of multiplying 500 by 3 results in 1500. I've checked this calculation for accuracy, and it correctly follows from the chosen operation and initial number.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n1500"
