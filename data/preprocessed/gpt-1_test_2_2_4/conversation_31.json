Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

This number is exactly in the middle of the specified range, making it a balanced choice.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation**:\n   - To add complexity, I will choose a transformation that involves both multiplication and addition.\n   - The transformations chosen are: multiplying the number by 3 and then adding 150. This transformation is not too complex but significantly alters the original number.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the number 500.\n   - Multiply by 3: \\( 500 \\times 3 = 1500 \\)\n   - Then add 150: \\( 1500 + 150 = 1650 \\)\n   - The transformed value becomes 1650 after applying the chosen mathematical operations.\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Value**: \n   - The calculations have been rechecked, and the final transformed value of 500 after applying the \"multiplied by 3 and add 150\" transformation is indeed 1650.\n\n### Final Hash Value:\nNow, as required, I will provide the final transformed result produced from the initial number 500, after applying the chosen operations. \n\n1650"
