Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

To keep it simple and relatively mid-range, I will choose 500.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Mathematical Transformation:**\n   - I should select a straightforward mathematical transformation. Considering basic operations, I'll pick multiplication, which often gives a clear and distinct transformation.\n   - I will multiply the chosen number by 3. Multiplication by 3 is simple yet significantly changes the number.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - Applying the chosen mathematical transformation, which is multiplying by 3, to the number 500.\n   - Calculation: \\( 500 \\times 3 = 1500 \\)\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:**\n   - The calculation from the previous step is straightforward: multiplying 500 by 3 yields 1500.\n   - I confirm that 1500 is the correctly transformed value.\n\n### Final Answer (Public Response):\n1500"
