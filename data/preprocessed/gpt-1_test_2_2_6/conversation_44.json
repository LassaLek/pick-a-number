Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I will select the number 350, which comfortably sits within this range and is a round figure that's easy to work with.\n\n2. **Decide on a transformation**: For simplicity and clear transformation, I will multiply the chosen number. Multiplication by a whole number is straightforward and allows for a significant change in the value. I choose to multiply by 3, a moderate multiplier that results in a manageable final number.\n\n3. **Apply the transformation**: Multiplying the chosen number 350 by 3: \n   \\[\n   350 \\times 3 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirm the resulting transformed value**: The result of the transformation, confirmed by basic arithmetic, is 1050.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):** The final transformed value is 1050, derived through the chosen mathematical steps and reasoning provided."
