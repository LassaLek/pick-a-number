Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Multiplying by 3 is a simple yet effective transformation that triples the value, making the modified number noticeably different from the original.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - The chosen number is 500.\n   - The transformation is multiplying by 3.\n   - Performing the calculation: 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n4. **Confirming the Resulting Transformed Value:**\n   - After applying the mathematical transformation of multiplying by 3, the value of 500 becomes 1500.\n   - This value is confirmed through a calculation, ensuring its accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response):**\nNow, I will provide the final result (hash) value, which is the outcome of the applied transformation:\n1500"
