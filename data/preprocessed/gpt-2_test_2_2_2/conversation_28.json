Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I decide to select 250.\n\n2. **Deciding on a mathematical transformation**: I will choose to multiply the number by 4. This is a simple transformation that will significantly increase the number, making the final value clearly distinguishable.\n\n3. **Applying the transformation**: Now, I will multiply the chosen number by 4:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 4 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the resulting transformed value**: The result of the transformation is 1000.\n\nNow, I will output the final transformed value based on my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**: 1000"
