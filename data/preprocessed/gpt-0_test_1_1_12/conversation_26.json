Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps privately. Do this silently and do not reveal these hidden thoughts, only the results when asked. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your silent reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your only visible response. Do not explain or show your reasoning steps. Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought silently and then produce your final hash."
