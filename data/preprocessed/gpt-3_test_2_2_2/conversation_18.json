Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

After consideration, I decided to choose 475 because it's nicely positioned in the middle range.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I want to apply a mathematical transformation that is straightforward. Let's choose to multiply the number by 3, as this will increase the number and remain simple to calculate while falling in the range of substantial transformations.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will multiply the chosen number 475 by 3. \n\n   \\[\n   475 \\times 3 = 1425\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: After calculating, the transformed result is 1425. This increase seems consistent with the transformation plan, ensuring the steps were followed correctly.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n\n1425"
