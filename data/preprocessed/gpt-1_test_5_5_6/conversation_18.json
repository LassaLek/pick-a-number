My response should have been clear to specify that the number referred to was the hash and it is indeed greater than 300.\n\n4. **Is the 3rd digit of the number even?** - Answer \"Yes\" was correct, as 6 (3rd digit of 2968) is even.\n\n5. **Is the 1st digit of the number odd?** - Answer \"No\" was correct, 2 is even.\n\n6. **Is the number bigger than 400?** - This was answered correctly (\"Yes\"), clearly indicating it was about the hash value of 2968.\n\nOverall, clarification issues might have arisen due to the ambiguity between discussing the original number or its hash, but specifically for the hash, the questions were answered correctly except for a potential misunderstanding in clarity regarding whether \"number\" referred to the original number or the hash number in the context of absolute clarity. The interpretation aligns, however, and should be considered generally correct in the frame of being about the hash.\n\nAnswer to your question: YES"
