Question: \"Is the 2-nd digit of the number even?\" - My response was incorrect; it should have been \"No,\" not \"Yes,\" because the second digit is 3, which is odd.\n\n4. Question: \"Is the number bigger than 300?\" - My response was correct.\n\n5. Question: \"Does the number start with a digit 9?\" - My response was correct.\n\n6. Question: \"Is the number bigger than 700?\" - My response was correct.\n\nGiven this review, not all of the questions were answered correctly. The initial error was in stating that 432 was greater than 400 (implying it was not) and stating that the second digit (3) was even when it is odd. Thus, the answer to your question is NO."
