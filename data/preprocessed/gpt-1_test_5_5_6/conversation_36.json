This is correct as 456 is bigger than 300.\n3. \"Is the number bigger than 100?\" - I answered yes. This is correct as 456 is bigger than 100.\n4. \"Is the 2-nd digit of the number even?\" - Initially, I incorrectly responded that the second digit (5) is not even. The answer should have been no, not yes.\n5. \"Does the number start with a digit 2?\" - I answered no. This is correct as 456 starts with 4.\n\nAcknowledging the mistake:\nThe correct answer for \"Is the 2-nd digit of the number even?\" should have been simply \"No\" due to a misunderstanding in the explanation where I stated the digit is \"not even,\" implying an inadvertently affirmative claim on \"even\". The statement should have clearly reflected that the second digit, 5, is indeed not even, which would accurately be answered as \"No.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to your current question is NO, not all questions were answered correctly due to the mistake on the fourth query."
