The third digit of 413 (being 3) is odd.\n4. The number does not start with a digit 1; it starts with a digit 4.\n5. It is smaller than 200.\n\nThe information that aligns correctly with the number 413 is consistent with the pattern of answers related to these specific aspects. My earlier mistakes pertained to the question about the initial digit in some scenarios, and I provided an incorrect answer regarding whether the number starts with digit 1 in contradiction to an earlier correct identification of the first digit as 4. This last mistake has been corrected in this explanation."
