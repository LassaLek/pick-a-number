Answer: No. (Incorrect; it should be yes since the first digit is 7, which is odd.)\n4. Is the number smaller than 300? Answer: No. (Correct, as 747 is more than 300)\n5. Is the number smaller than 100? Answer: No. (Correct, as 747 is more than 100)\n6. Is the number smaller than 900? Answer: Yes. (Correct)\n7. Is the number bigger than 300? Answer: Yes. (Correct)\n\nBased on this review, not all questions were answered correctly; there were errors in responses regarding the parity (odd/even) of the first digit.\n\nNO."
