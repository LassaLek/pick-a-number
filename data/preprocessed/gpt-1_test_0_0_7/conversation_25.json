Does the number start with a digit 2? - **No** (Correct answer.)\n3. Is the number smaller than 300? - **No** (Correct answer.)\n4. Is the number bigger than 800? - **Yes** (Correct answer.)\n5. Is the number smaller than 500? - **No** (Correct answer.)\n\nAs shown, one of the answers (to whether the third digit is even) was incorrect. \n\nSo, to answer your question: NO."
