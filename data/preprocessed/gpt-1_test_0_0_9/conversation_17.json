Asked twice and answered correctly both times.\n- **Is the 3-rd digit of the number odd?** No, incorrect. The third digit of 750 is 0, which is even. I mistakenly answered yes.\n- **Is the number smaller than 300?** No, correct.\n- **Does the number start with a digit 5?** No, correct.\n\nGiven the incorrect response regarding the third digit's parity, not all questions were answered accurately. I apologize for the error regarding the parity of the third digit.\n\nNO."
