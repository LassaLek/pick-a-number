The number is not smaller than 100.\n7. The number is not smaller than 300.\n8. The number is smaller than 400 (incorrect because it is 937).\n9. The number does not start with a digit 9 (incorrect because it does start with 9).\n10. The number is not smaller than 700.\n\nFrom these results, there were mistakes in the responses about whether the number is smaller than 900, smaller than 400, and whether it starts with a digit 9.\n\nSo, NOT all questions were answered correctly.\n\nAnswer: NO"
