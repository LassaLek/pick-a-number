I confirmed the number is not bigger than 900.\n5. The second digit was asked to be even, and I replied, \"Yes,\" which is correct since the second digit is 2.\n6. Asked again if the first digit is odd, and the answer was \"No,\" correct.\n7. Asked if the number is bigger than 200, my answer was \"Yes,\" accurate.\n8. Asked if the number is bigger than 700, my answer was \"Yes,\" accurate.\n9. Asked if the number is bigger than 600, my answer was \"Yes,\" correct too.\n10. Finally, the third digit was asked to be odd, and I replied, \"No,\" aligning with the number where the third digit is 4.\n\nMy earlier responses are consistent with the original number, 824. Therefore, all of those questions were answered correctly. The answer is: YES."
