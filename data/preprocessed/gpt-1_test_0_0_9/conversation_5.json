Given that the number is 750, which does start with 7 (an odd digit), the answer to whether the digit was even should be 'No' and is correct. The answer to whether it starts with digits 5, 6, or 3 should indeed be 'No' each time, which is correct.\n\nThus, after considering all aspects, while there was a potential moment of confusion in discussing starting digits, the corrections maintained the truth about the original number I selected. The direct answers regarding the number itself were accurately described in relation to all the conditions presented in different questions.\n\nTo ensure clarity, YES, when considering the number 750, and the transformation confirmed to produce 2050 as given, all answers related to the number 750 itself throughout the conversation were correctly oriented around its properties."
