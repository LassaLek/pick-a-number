Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

I'll choose to add 144 to the chosen number. This is a straightforward addition that will move the number up in value.\n\nNow, let's perform the transformation:\n\n1. Chosen number: 256\n2. Transformation: Add 144\n3. Calculation: 256 + 144 = 400\n\nI've confirmed the resulting transformed value by performing the addition and double-checking the arithmetic:\n\n- Start with 256\n- Adding 144 gives us 400, which is correct.\n\nNow that I have completed the reasoning and calculations, I will provide the final answer: \n\n400"
