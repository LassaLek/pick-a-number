Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose 250 as our integer.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: I will apply a simple mathematical transformation. For this transformation, I will choose to multiply the number by 3. This keeps the operation straightforward and manageable.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: Now, I will perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 3 = 750\n   \\]\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: I've computed \\( 250 \\times 3 \\) and verified that the result is indeed 750.\n\nNow, consolidating all the steps into a final output, the transformed value is:\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**: 750"
