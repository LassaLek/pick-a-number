Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For this example, I will choose the number **400**. \n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. I will choose to add **250** to this number. \n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:\n\n**Step 1:** Start with the chosen number:\n- 400\n\n**Step 2:** Apply the transformation (addition):\n- 400 + 250 = 650\n\nNow, I will confirm the resulting transformed value. The computation was straightforward:\n- I added 250 to 400, which gives me 650.\n\nNow I have successfully completed all steps and arrived at my final transformed value.\n\nFinal Answer (Public Response):\n650"
