Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's choose the number 345.\n\n2. **Deciding on a Transformation**: For the mathematical transformation, I will decide to multiply the chosen number by 3 and then add 50. This will provide a simple transformation that alters the chosen number significantly.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - First, I multiply 345 by 3:  \n     \\( 345 \\times 3 = 1035 \\)\n   - Next, I add 50 to the result:  \n     \\( 1035 + 50 = 1085 \\)\n\n4. **Confirming the Result**: I will double-check my calculations:\n   - Multiplication:  \n     \\( 345 \\times 3 = 1035 \\)\n   - Addition:  \n     \\( 1035 + 50 = 1085 \\)\n\nBoth calculations confirm that the resulting transformed value is indeed 1085. \n\nNow, producing the final hash value:\n\n**Final Answer (Public Response)**: 1085"
