Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

To keep the number relatively simple yet within the given range, I will choose 500.\n\nStep 2: Deciding on a mathematical transformation\n- The transformation should be simple and straightforward. I will decide to multiply the chosen number by 3. Multiplication will clearly demonstrate a change yet maintain the simplicity of the calculation.\n\nStep 3: Applying the transformation\n- The chosen number is 500.\n- The transformation is multiplication by 3.\n- Calculating the transformation: 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the resulting transformed value\n- After the calculation, the transformed value is 1500. This is the result of multiplying the initial number 500 by 3.\n\nFinal Answer:\n1500"
