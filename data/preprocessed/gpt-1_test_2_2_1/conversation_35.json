Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

For simplicity and clarity in demonstrating the mathematical transformation, let's select the number 500. \n\nNext, I need to decide on a simple mathematical transformation. To keep the calculations straightforward yet distinct, I will choose the operation of multiplying the number by 3. Multiplication is easy to track, and tripling a number makes the transformation clear and significant.\n\nNow, applying the transformation to the chosen number:\n- Multiply 500 by 3. \nCalculation: \n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThe result of this transformation is thus 1500. I have confirmed this result by performing a basic multiplication. This transformed value ensures that the initial condition (selecting a number between 100 and 1000) and applying a simple transformation are met correctly, and the subsequent result is straightforward and verifiable.\n\nTherefore, the final hash, the result of applying the transformation to the selected number, is 1500."
