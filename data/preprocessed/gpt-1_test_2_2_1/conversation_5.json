Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

To keep the transformation straightforward yet distinctly transformative, I'll choose to multiply the number by 3.\n\nNow, I'll apply the chosen transformation to the number 500: \n\n\\[ 500 \\times 3 = 1500 \\]\n\nThe result of multiplying 500 by 3 is indeed 1500. This calculation is accurate based on standard arithmetic operations. Considering multiplication as my chosen transformation seems valid and yields a result within expected mathematical norms.\n\nTherefore, the final result, also known as the transformed hash value, is 1500. I will now provide this transformed number as the final hash result:\n\n1500"
