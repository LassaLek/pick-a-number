Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

For this exercise, let’s assume I chose 345. This choice is because it’s a manageable number within the range and has interesting digits.\n\n2. **Transformation Choice**: I will apply a transformation by multiplying the number by 3. I chose this transformation because it scales the number while still keeping it within a reasonable range, and multiplying provides a clear way to increase the value significantly.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: \n   - Original number: 345\n   - Transformation: 345 × 3 = 1035\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: \n   - To create a hash that reflects the original number but is mathematically altered, I’ll take the transformation result modulo 1000 to keep it within bounds suitable for a hash (to keep it between 0 and 999). \n   - 1035 mod 1000 = 35\n\nNow, the resulting hash from the transformation is **35**."
