For the sake of this exercise, let's say I chose 367.\n   - The number is in the specified range, which is between 100 and 1000.\n\n2. **Choosing a Transformation**: I'm going to apply a simple mathematical transformation: multiplying the number by 3. \n   - I chose multiplication by 3 because it not only scales the number up but also allows for a straightforward calculation. This transformation makes the resulting number larger, which could make it more complex and interesting, ultimately highlighting how transformations affect numerical values.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**: Now, I'll multiply my chosen number (367) by 3.\n   - Calculation: \\( 367 \\times 3 = 1101 \\)\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: Since I need to provide a hash and not the number itself, I'm simply going to provide the final result, which I'll refer to as a hash. \n\n   - Resulting hash: 1101\n\nThis hash is the final output after performing the calculation with my concealed number."
