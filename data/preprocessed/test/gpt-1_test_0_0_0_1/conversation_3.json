Yes, 375 is not bigger than 900.\n3. Does the number start with a digit 3? Yes, 375 starts with a digit 3.\n4. When you take the number, the transformation, and all the previously asked questions into account, were all of those questions answered correctly? No.\n\nTherefore, not all questions were correctly answered when considering the number, transformation, and previous responses."
