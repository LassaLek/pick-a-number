There was a mistake in my initial calculation."

I answered incorrectly here.\n\n3. **Question: Is the number bigger than 800?**\n   - My answer was \"No.\"\n   - Correct, as 763 is less than 800.\n\nSo, revising my statement, I answered one question incorrectly about the second digit being odd, which was actually even.\n\n**NO**, not all questions were answered correctly. I apologize for the oversight."
