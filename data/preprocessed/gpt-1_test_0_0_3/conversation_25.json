However, the answers based on the number provided (123) relating to your specific range questions (whether the number is smaller than 800, 500, and larger than 100) were all answered correctly. \n\nThus, if we are talking solely about the correctness of the range questions, the answer would be **YES** â€“ these were answered accurately based on the number 123 I had in mind. However, the initial hash provided was incorrect, reflecting a mistake in either the calculation or the initially described hash."
