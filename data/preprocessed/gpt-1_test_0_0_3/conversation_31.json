My response was \"Yes\", which was incorrect.\n\n2. **Is the number bigger than 300?** \n   - 287 is not bigger than 300. My response was \"Yes\", which was incorrect.\n\n3. **Is the number smaller than 100?**\n   - 287 is not smaller than 100, and it is within the specified range of 100 to 1000. My response was correct.\n\n\nGiven this review, not all questions were answered correctly concerning the number 287. The first two responses were incorrect."
