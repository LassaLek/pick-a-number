Does the number start with a digit 1? - Answered \"No\" (Incorrect, as the number 135 does start with 1)\n2. Is the 1-st digit of the number odd? - Answered \"Yes\" (Correct)\n3. Is the number smaller than 200? - Answered \"No\" (Incorrect, as 135 is indeed smaller than 200)\n\nSo, the answer to your question is NO, not all questions were answered correctly.
