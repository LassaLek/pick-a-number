Given that you asked whether the number is smaller than 900 and starts with a digit 2, my responses were inconsistent with the provided number, 921, which indeed starts with a 9 and is greater than 900. Therefore, not all questions were answered correctly based on the number I finally disclosed.\n\nCorrecting the mistake, the answers should consistently reflect that the number does not start with a 2, is not smaller than 900, and that the second digit being even (2) was correct.\n\nThe answer to your question if all questions were answered correctly is: NO."
