Answered correctly: YES.\n\n2. You asked if the number was smaller than 700. Since 256 is indeed smaller than 700, the correct answer should have been YES, but I answered NO. This was incorrect.\n\n3. You asked if the number was smaller than 300. Since 256 is smaller than 300, the answer I gave, which was NO, was incorrect.\n\nBased on these points, not all questions were answered correctly. The answers to the second and third questions were incorrect."
