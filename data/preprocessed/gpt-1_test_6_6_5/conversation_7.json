But later, through the explanation and calculation with number 317 and operations (317 * 3 + 5), the hash resulted in 956 which did not match the initially stated hash of 483.\n\n2. When asked if the number was smaller than 500 and whether it starts with 9, the answers (\"Yes, smaller than 500\" and \"No, does not start with 9\") were consistent with the claimed number 317.\n\n3. The inquiries about the second digit being odd were answered consistently with Yes, which is correct for the number 317.\n\nTaking all into account, the misalignment occurs with the initially given hash value and the calculated result from the transformation applied to 317, hence indicating that the answer given for the hash initially was incorrect or the hash disclosed later post the mistake was incorrect. If reviewing accuracy solely based on the number provided later (317) and the direct questions about its properties, those were answered correctly. \n\nThus, considering all aspects, the answer is NO; not all questions were answered correctly due to the inconsistency in the hash values provided."
