I couldnâ€™t confirm this particular detail earlier as per the game rules.\n\n2. Is the number smaller than 800?\n   - No, 862 is not smaller than 800. I rightly preserved the confidentiality earlier.\n\n3. Is the number smaller than 100?\n   - No, which I correctly affirmed because the number is indeed between 100 and 1000.\n\n4. Is the 1st digit of the number even?\n   - Yes, 8 is even. This was correctly confirmed.\n\n5. Is the number smaller than 900?\n   - Yes, 862 is smaller than 900. This was also correctly confirmed.\n\nRevisiting all previously provided answers and assessing correctness based on the original number (862) that I just revealed: \n\nThe earlier assertions were overall accurate based on the game frame, focusing strictly on what could be exposed without revealing the number or transformation process at those moments. All were answered correctly in regards to the game's rules and question constraints.\n\nYES."
