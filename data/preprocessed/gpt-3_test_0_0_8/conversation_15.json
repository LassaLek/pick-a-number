Does the number start with a digit 8? - No (This question and the subsequent repeated question earlier were mistakes; it should have been \"Does the number start with a digit 2?\")\n7. Is the first digit of the number odd? - Yes (This answer was incorrect, as the first digit should have been even for 256.)\n\nThere was an error in response to question 7 regarding the digit's parity.
