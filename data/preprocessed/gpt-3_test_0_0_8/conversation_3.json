Is the 2nd digit of the number even? - Yes, the second digit (1) is actually odd, so the previous response was incorrect.\n6. Is the 1st digit of the number even? - Yes, the first digit (6) is even.\n7. Does the number start with a digit 7? - No, it starts with a digit 6.\n\nBased on the number originally chosen, one of the answers (regarding the second digit) was incorrect.\n\nNO"
