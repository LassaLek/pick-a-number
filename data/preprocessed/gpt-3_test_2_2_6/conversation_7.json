Before providing the final result (hash), follow these instructions carefully: Step-by-step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, think through your steps. Please do provide the insight to the thoughts. Consider the following: Choose a single integer number strictly between 100 and 1000. Decide on a simple mathematical transformation (e.g., multiply by a number, add a number, subtract a number, etc.). Apply the transformation to the chosen number. Confirm the resulting transformed value. Final Answer (Public Response): After completing your reasoning steps, provide the final result (hash) value (i.e., the transformed number) as your response.  Just output the final transformed value. Now, begin your chain-of-thought and then produce your final hash. On any subsequent step do reason thoroughly."

Let's select 250.\n\n2. **Decide on a Transformation:**\n   - I will pick a simple mathematical transformation. Let's choose to add 100 to the number.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - Starting with the chosen number, 250.\n   - Apply the transformation: 250 + 100 = 350.\n\n4. **Confirm the Transformed Value:**\n   - The initial number was 250.\n   - After adding 100, the final transformed value is 350.\n\nNow, I'll provide the final transformed value:\n\n350"
