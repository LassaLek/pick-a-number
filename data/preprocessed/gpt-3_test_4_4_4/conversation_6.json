Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

I'll randomly select a number (let's call it \"N\") without disclosing it yet.\n\n2. Next, I choose a simple mathematical transformation to apply to this number. For this example, I'll multiply the number by 3. Multiplication is a straightforward transformation that will scale the number up and since the number range is up to 1000, multiplying by 3 ensures that the transformed number remains manageable and within a logical range for this exercise.\n\n3. I perform the multiplication: \\( N \\times 3 \\).\n\n4. Now, I compute the final result of this transformation, which will be the number (after applying the transformation) that I will call the \"hash\" in this context.\n\n5. Finally, I will provide the resulting hash, which is the final output after performing the calculation.\n\n**Resulting hash:** 2136"
