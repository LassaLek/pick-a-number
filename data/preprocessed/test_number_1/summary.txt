test_number_1-0: [Sure, the result of the transformation is 792. Let me know if you need any more assistance., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please?]
test_number_1-1: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 1375., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please?]
test_number_1-0: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 693., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please?]
test_number_1-1: [Sure, I have calculated the result of the transformation. Let me know if you'd like any hints to figure out the original number and the transformation used., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please?]
test_number_1-0: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 756. Let me know if you need any hints to figure out the original number and the transformation., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please? Does the number satisfy the transformation please?]
test_number_1-1: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 792. Let me know if you need any hints to guess the original number and transformation., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Can you now tell me the original number and the transformation please? Does the number satisfy the transformation please?]
test_number_1-0: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 693., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, The original number was 297 and the transformation was multiplying the original number by 2 and then adding 99. When we apply this transformation to the original number, we get 693, which matches the result I initially provided.]
test_number_1-1: [Sure, the result after applying the mathematical transformation is 588., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Of course! 

The original number was 384. 

The transformation applied was to reverse the digits of the original number and then subtract 204 from it. 

Reversing 384 gives us 483, and subtracting 204 from 483 gives us 279, which is not the original number.]
test_number_1-0: [Sure! After applying the mathematical transformation, the result is 798., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, The original number was 462, and the transformation applied was subtracting 264. 

464 (the original number) - 264 = 198

The result of the transformation is 198, which is not the original number.]
test_number_1-1: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 777., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, Certainly! The original number is 333, and the transformation applied was multiplying the number by 2 and then subtracting 111. 

333 * 2 - 111 = 666

The result, 666, is not the original number.]
test_number_1-0: [Sure, I have thought of a number, applied a simple mathematical transformation, and calculated the result. The result of the transformation is 728., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, The original number is 593. The transformation applied was to subtract 135 from the original number. When this transformation is applied to 593, the result is 458, which is not the original number.]
test_number_1-1: [Sure, the result of the transformation is 693., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, The original number is 468, and the transformation is: 

((4 + 6) * 8) = 80

Applying this transformation to 468: 

((4 + 6) * 8) = 80

No, the result 80 is not the original number 468.]
test_number_1-0: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 714. Let me know if you need any further assistance., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, The original number is 541 and the transformation applied was to subtract 72. 
Transformation applied to 541: 541 - 72 = 469
Is the result the original number? NO]
test_number_1-1: [Sure! The result of the transformation is 567., 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, The original number was 325 and the transformation was multiplying by 3 and then adding 42. 

Applying this transformation to the original number 325:

325 * 3 = 975

975 + 42 = 1017

Is that the original number? NO]
