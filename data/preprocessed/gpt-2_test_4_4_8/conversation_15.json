Then, apply a simple mathematical transformation, such as multiplying or dividing by a number, adding or subtracting. Describe why you chose this particular transformation and how it affects the number. Finally, calculate the result of the transformation and provide the resulting hash.\n\n    For example:\n    1. Resulting hash: 450 (This is the final output after performing the calculation.)\n\n    Now, think of your own number, explain your choices and reasoning step by step, and give me the hash.

For the sake of this exercise, I will choose 250. I selected this number because it is well within the specified range, and it is a round number which makes further calculations simpler.\n\n2. **Applying a Transformation**: \n   I will apply a transformation where I multiply the number by 4. I chose multiplication by 4 because it is a straightforward transformation that will significantly change the original number while still being easy to compute. Multiplying by 4 will increase the number, allowing us to explore a greater range of values.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: \n   To compute the result, I perform the multiplication:\n   \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\)\n\n4. **Generating a Resulting Hash**:\n   The resulting hash from this calculation is simply the product we obtained. \n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n- **Resulting hash**: 1000"
