Let's say I choose 350. \n\n**Reasoning:** I chose this number because it's a round value that sits comfortably between 100 (the lower limit) and 1000 (the upper limit). It’s not too low or high, making it easier to work with for transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Apply a Mathematical Transformation\nI will apply a transformation by multiplying the number by 2. \n\n**Reasoning for Transformation:** \n- Multiplication by a factor of 2 serves to significantly change the original number while still keeping it within a manageable range, as the maximum possible outcome (2000) does not exceed a reasonable realm for further calculations.\n- This transformation helps illustrate the scaling effect of multiplication.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Result\nNow let’s calculate the result of the transformation:\n\n\\[ 350 \\times 2 = 700 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Resulting Hash\nTo give the resulting hash based on the calculations:\n\n**Resulting hash:** 700\n\nThis is the final output after performing the calculation."
