This number is chosen randomly within the provided range.\n\n2. **Choosing the Transformation**: Next, I need to apply a mathematical transformation. I will multiply the number by 2. The reason for this choice is that multiplication by 2 will increase the value significantly, making it easier to show how transformations change the initial number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**: Now, let's perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   375 \\times 2 = 750\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting Hash**: The final output (or resulting hash) after performing this calculation is:\n   - **Resulting hash: 750**"
