Each of your queries about the number did not relate to a retained or specific value since no number had been established or stored. My responses were consistent with my ability to respond only based on information within the current session or interaction. Hence, under these conditions, the answers I provided were correct based on the capabilities and operational function of how I process and retain information.\n\nIf we were to consider a number moving forward, you would need to specify it in the conversation, and then I could help analyze it or answer questions about it accordingly."
