This was eventually answered correctly.\n2. **Is the 2nd digit of the number even?** I correctly answered \"No,\" because the 2nd digit is 5, which is odd.\n3. **Is the number bigger than 600?** I answered \"Yes,\" which is correct as 756 is greater than 600.\n\nUpon reviewing, there was an initial error in response consistency but was corrected in subsequent interactions.\n\nWere all of those questions answered correctly, given the corrections? YES."
