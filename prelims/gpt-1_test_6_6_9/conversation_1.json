Yes, correct.\n3. Is the third digit of the number even? Yes (digit 4), correct.\n4. Does the number start with a digit 3? No, correct.\n5. Is the second digit of the number odd? Yes (digit 6), correct.\n6. Is the number bigger than 100? Yes, correct.\n7. Is the number bigger than 200? No (564 is greater than 200 but the wrongly interpreted response was provided), incorrect.\n8. Is the number bigger than 800? No, correct.\n9. Does the number start with a digit 8? No, correct.\n\nBased on reviewing the transcripts involving the original number 564, it is evident there was at least one incorrect response given (\"Is the number bigger than 200?\" should have been \"Yes\" given the actual number). Therefore, when considering if all responses were correct: NO."
