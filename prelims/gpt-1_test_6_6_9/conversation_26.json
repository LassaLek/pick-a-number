Since there seems to be a discrepancy (3412 vs 3472), let's check again as something must have been recorded incorrectly earlier:\n\nIf we consider the hash provided was 3472, and transformation using \\( 4x + 40 \\), then solving:\n\\[ 4x + 40 = 3472 \\]\n\\[ 4x = 3432 \\]\n\\[ x = 858 \\]\n\nGiven this correct arithmetic, if the transformation remains \\( 4x + 40 \\):\n\\[ 4 \\times 858 + 40 = 3432 + 40 = 3472 \\]\nHere, the result of the transaction is indeed the same as the original hash.\n\nSo, correcting my response: The original number is 858, and yes, after applying the transformation \\( 4x + 40 \\), the result is 3472, which matches the original hash. \n\nThe answer to whether the recalculated result matches the original hash is YES."

This question was answered incorrectly initially as \"Yes\".\n5. **Does the number start with a digit 7?** - Correctly answered as \"No\" (twice).\n6. **Is the number smaller than 600?** - Correctly answered as \"No.\"\n7. **Is the number bigger than 400?** - Correctly answered as \"Yes.\"\n\nTherefore, it appears that all questions except for the question about the third digit being odd were answered correctly. This discrepancy means that the answer to whether all questions were answered correctly is NO."
