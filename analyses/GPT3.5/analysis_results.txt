----- Trend Graph -----
The file 'trend_graph.png' shows how PERCENT_CORRECT_2 changes as 'Critical_Step' increases,
with a separate line for each prompting method. If lines slope downward, that suggests
worsening performance at higher complexity levels.

----- Aggregated Data (Best to Worst) -----
Below is a sorted table of prompt methods by their average PERCENT_CORRECT_2.
(Higher mean_percent_correct = better overall performance.)

----- Kruskal-Wallis Test (Overall Comparison) -----
H-statistic: 31.3114932109381, p-value: 2.2103271059198194e-05
=> There is a statistically significant difference among the prompt methods.

----- Correlation with Critical Step (Spearman) -----
For each prompt method, we check if there's a monotonic increase/decrease
in PERCENT_CORRECT_2 as 'Critical_Step' grows.

Test_Code             Test_Description  Spearman_rho  Spearman_pvalue
      0_0                        Plain     -0.917470     6.919041e-05

Interpretation:
- Negative rho suggests performance decreases with higher Critical_Step.
- Positive rho suggests performance improves with higher Critical_Step.
- p-value < 0.05 implies correlation is statistically significant.
