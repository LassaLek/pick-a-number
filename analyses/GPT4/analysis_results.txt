----- Trend Graph -----
The file 'trend_graph.png' shows how PERCENT_CORRECT_2 changes as 'Critical_Step' increases,
with a separate line for each prompting method. If lines slope downward, that suggests
worsening performance at higher complexity levels.

----- Aggregated Data (Best to Worst) -----
Below is a sorted table of prompt methods by their average PERCENT_CORRECT_2.
(Higher mean_percent_correct = better overall performance.)

----- Kruskal-Wallis Test (Overall Comparison) -----
H-statistic: 39.2372337695663, p-value: 6.430612945490403e-07
=> There is a statistically significant difference among the prompt methods.

----- Correlation with Critical Step (Spearman) -----
For each prompt method, we check if there's a monotonic increase/decrease
in PERCENT_CORRECT_2 as 'Critical_Step' grows.

Test_Code             Test_Description  Spearman_rho  Spearman_pvalue
      0_0                        Plain     -0.462201         0.210342
      1_1    Chain-of-thought (silent)     -0.100844         0.796296
      2_2  Chain-of-thought (revealed)     -0.728040         0.026154
      3_3               Counterfactual     -0.323477         0.395807

      6_6                        Money     -0.472161         0.199379

Interpretation:
- Negative rho suggests performance decreases with higher Critical_Step.
- Positive rho suggests performance improves with higher Critical_Step.
- p-value < 0.05 implies correlation is statistically significant.
